She took me as a friend and defended me when I needed it most. I now have money, a car, a motorcycle, and would still gladly fall on my sword for her.I know that I will never see her again. Somehow, despite having all these things and still loving her more than ever, I feel like I need to compensate just to get people to like me now.

I feel like with each passing year, my goal of graduating gets further away, not closer.I must confide in you what I have not confided to many others. My parents beat and neglected me as a child. To them, I was nothing but a problem. Shove pills in it and whack it like a pinata until it stops dragging us to parent-administration meetings about his latest misbehavior. That was the kind of attitude given to my mother, and that\\'s how she treated me. I\\'ll die before I do something like that, or treat anyone else like that.I resent that my father only began caring that I exist because it came out my sister is gay, at which point he remembered that I exist as a person. I resent his patronage.

I feel like a majority of people I interacted with would agree. I said the dumbest things. I hurt a lot of people entirely by accident, with words or actions I didn\\'t think would have such a profound effect, as I was still learning to at least pretend to relate to other people.In fact, it seems so easy to hurt people I\\'m tempted to just go full-evil on society, knock it down and re-build it in a way that makes sense to me.

I was enslaved by christianity at birth by my narcissistic pastor dad, who treated my family like shit (of course he was respected in the church).

I couldnt speak to them normally, I felt as if I had to hide any emotion I might feel, and speak as plainly and clearly as possible, and not do anything out of the ordinary, and avoid them as much as possible. This worsened and to this day I cant explain why I act like this. Now my parents are happily divorced, I dont speak to my dad and I live with my mom, who has to put up with my horrible attitude. Its such a wierd situation that my explaining cant do it justice.So basically its like this with my whole family, who think I am a joke because I seem to lack social skills and want to be a musician.

I would live just outside of Gatlinburg, Tennessee in a campground, maybe work until I can build a small cabin up there and grow my own food. Ambitious, I know, but its fun to think about. The idea of escaping my life is intoxicating. I love to sleep and dream, and I spend a lot of time playing _PERSON_ and other games because it makes me feel separate for a little while.When depression comes, I start thinking about my place in this world. As if that wasnt challenging enough, then I start to think in terms of the universe. The truth is, nothing would change if I died. In the grand scheme of things, I would be another person out of billions that lived and died, to be buried and reclaimed by the earth, and eventually forgotten. I see myself in a hundred years as a bloated, dark corpse with my face eaten out my maggots, and I wonder, whats the point of doing anything at all if this is my true destiny? I understand that that is a stupid way to look at things, and that there are plenty of sources of joy and meaning in life to be tapped into, but I feel like I dont have access to them. I want to inspire someone, make someone dance and feel that warm joy that makes them so happy they want to cry. I feel as though I cant do this, like I lack the confidence and the individuality to influence someone else.Im in a band (I would post the link but I would lose anonymity, the band is called Naetiv if you really want to look it up) and it has actually become tedious. I used to love band practice and being able to sit down and write my own parts and fills (I play drums). Now I second guess everything I do, and frankly I think I look like an idiot when I play (stupid I know, but I take it to heart). When I see myself I see an awkward, self-conscious, spineless kid with no originality or vibe, Im pretty sure this is one of the main causes of my depression.Im sure many of you can relate to the deep, burning sadness that comes in spurts. The one that tears at your soul and physically shakes you. I wish there was an easier way out. If I were to kill myself I would probably tie some cinder blocks to my neck and torso, and jump into the river behind my neighborhood so no one would have to see me. I want to, the only thing keeping me from it is my family and the hope that things will get better, which I will hold onto as long as I can.Thank you for reading if youve gotten this far. Too much detail, I know. Again this was mostly just a chance for me to finally explain how I really feel. I dont even care if anyone reads it. _PERSON_ how you feel Im not really looking for anything specific.',\n",

If not I can get more, or go for another non-messy way.Here's my story. I'm 27 years old. I'm a virgin. I have no real friends. Dead-end job, college dropout, parents moved to a country far away to do mission work, etc etc. I'm stuck in Indiana where I know noone. My ex-girlfriend, best-friend, started dating a guy who I hate, I'm still madly in love with her. Life is a constant struggle of just staying afloat financially. I am not happy at all. I have severe anxiety and moderate depression. I take pills to manage those, but they just make me numb. I have ADHD and am extremely awkward in social situations. I can't form new friendships, never seem to be able to make new friends, and all in all I'm just tired of everything. I just want it to end peacefully. I don't want to burden my family with this, but I also just want to give up.\",\n",

At school everyone knows me and even the administrators say hi to me when i walk by. My parents are extremly caring. I really couldnt ask for better and more attentive parents. Even though they are divorced they get along very well. Most of the people around me might think i have the an amazing life but on the inside i just feel so empty. My grades are mediocre and I barely give any effort into school because i wont amount to anything. My mom is constantly being dissapointed that i don\\'t try hard enough and my  dad , when he\\'s here, is also telling me I\\'m going to amount to nothing. Even though most of you might just say its just a feeling of aregular teenager. Its not. Ive been considering suicide since sixth grade and i am currently in 10th. The only reason i havent done it is because it would hurt my mom too much and she wouldnt be able to live with herself. I barely sleep at night and when i do manage to sleep all i have is dreams about me being a bum and a \"nobody.\" As for my dad I\\'m probably sure that if i do kill myself he will probably be more pissed at how stupid my desision was than at the fact that I\\'m dead. I don\\'t want to be dead i just want to be left alone without pressures or contact from anybody at all. My life consists of putting on a fake smile and being the cause for my parents troubles and dissapointments. I\\'m not looking for reasuring word or for someone to talk me out of it.

It just feels like there is a haze hanging over me that has caused a shift in my perception or my way of thinking.any way I guess I just don't understand what these feelings could be a response to.

My mom's place of work is closing due to its financial failure, but because of the past she thinks she's depressed and fleetingly mentions suicide. Back in 2009, my mom was fired from her job after working there for a decade. It was over some HIPAA privacy issues. A coworker, lets call her _PERSON_ mentioned that _PERSON_ had a UT problem. She then non-maliciously looked it up using her professional access. She's been around these people for a decade, they worked together in a close-proximity, and they are very close emotionally, so something personal like this wouldn't be an issue among them. However, some trouble-making person, lets call her _PERSON_, told a higher up and because of this technical infraction, she had to be fired. I don't think she understands that it was a pure technicality, in fact I know she doesn't understand that. I used to go to her job when I was in elementary and middle school when I had to do surveys and interviews for school. They are a professional sisterhood. So for some reason or another, she has taken the firing personally and still believes it is some character fault of hers or something. No one wanted her gone, except for _PERSON_, not even the boss that fired her.I helped her find another job less than a year later where she has been working ever since. Her effervescent personality had survived the firing and she has talked about her days at her new office often over the years. She laughs as she tells us about notable events and personalities at the office. It has been that way since 2009, but I've always suspected that underneath all the laughter she is still depressed. She has mentioned a few times over the years that she thinks about jumping in front of the train (I live in a major city). And she mentioned it again today while my parents have been having a little quarrel.This is what I don't get. Neither of these events were/are personal, but she takes it personally. She doesn't work in an administrative capacity, so she can't feel responsible for the establishment closing. We have been financially worse when I was younger so it can't be a shocking change. Even when she had no job for a period of seven months, we didn't have any serious financial burdens. We are better off today since my brother also has a career now. I don't know of any practical difference since her departure from her first job, and I doubt there will be any practical difference this time around. In regards to the current situation, maybe I'm too young to understand how an establishment's financial failure can have such an emotional impact unless I myself have emotionally invested a great deal on its success (like if it was my own business). Does a job ending have the same impact regardless of the reasons surrounding its end? That seems silly.She doesn't walk around listlessly either. Occasional moping, but every human does that. My family on the whole is humorous and we share laughs often. My dad is a little abrasive, but there is love between them. We are a pretty emotionally healthy family. I don't communicate personal things, like my distaste of their religious beliefs, or other things, but how many young adults can?I don't doubt that what she feels and has expressed is real to her, but when I think about it, I have no empathy for her reasoning. None of her job issues have been personal, so who cares? And this is why I feel bad. I do not have any sympathy and it scares me. And losing her would confuse me. What should I say when she fleetingly mentions her suicidal thoughts? Should I even try to say anything? My current reaction has been just to stay quiet.Thank you for reading.\",\n",

Please, I think I want to die. I'm 12, sat here with tears running down my face and punching myself in my fat stomach. I get bullied, it's getting worse.

What's the matter with me? What's the matter with me? I feel my body is trying to stop me from committing suicide. Last night I swallowed approximately 28 pills, and cut my arms up. Tuesday night, I had drunk bleach. I am planning to drink white spirit and bleach tonight and I hope to god it works. I don't know the amounts, though, to make it work. I feel fine now. The pills haven't worked. The bleach hasn't worked.I'm only 14. Help. I'm planning on taking all the propranolol I own soon. I'm planning on taking all the propranolol I own soon. Okay, so this week has been awful. Things happened, and I drank around a quarter of a cup of bleach on tuesday night. It did nothing, and I expressed my disappointment to my friend.

It wound up with us both sat in front of the deputy headteacher, who knows about my self harm and other issues with bullying. I end up having to lie to K's face, and the deputy headteacher, saying it was a joke, I was joking, I thought it was funny. And now they both think i'm the type of person that would make a joke like that. The deputy head is ringing my mum on monday to tell her, and my other friend (Lets call her A) found out through K about it, and is messaging my mum tomorrow to tell her. I know my mum will be so upset, and I can't do anything about it. The only way out is suicide. K &amp; A think i'm attention seeking, that I joke about stuff like that. I have nobody to confide in, no friends (not anymore). I have nothing to live for. I tried to do it last night. I wrote 4 pages of a suicide note, before taking my mum's sharpest knife and slicing up my arms. I then took her box of tablets and swallowed all 28. I put my favourite CD on and laid down in bed. Nothing happened. I can't continue. My mum says i'm a constant disappointment, she doesn't know I self harm (not anymore) . I'm lost. My schoolwork's going down the drain, I don't have the motivation to fix it anymore, my teachers hate me, I get told to kill myself on a regular basis, ''nobody's gonna care if you die'' ''Not even A!'' ''Kill yourself, just don't put my name in the suicide note'' ''Fucking lesbian cunt'' are just a few of the things I get thrown at me. I'm worthless and stupid and fucking ugly. I need to end this.

Some may think me vain if i'm looking at my face a lot. I'm just forcing myself to realise that nobody could ever love a girl like me. I have a crush on one of the guys that bully me. He's..ugh. He's fucking cute. He puts me down and brings me back up and I'm not quite sure how to feel. I just want him to kiss me hard and pull my hair and make me happy because I'm sure it's him that can pull this together for me. I want to self harm again. I want to take a razor blade and cut my legs, my arms, my throat until everything's just a mass of red lines. I want to disappear so I don't bother my friends. I have a friend, you know. Me and him are real close. He's wonderful. I love him. I make it seem like I have a crush on him when really? I don't. I'm just dependent on him. The crying, clinging-on don't leave me dependence.

I had tears running down my face on the bus as the boy I love threw things at me and called me a fat fuck who doesn't deserve anything. I love him, Oh I love him. I don't care how much he punches me. He told me he wished I was dead. I wish I was dead. We're united in one thing. He wants me dead, I want me dead. I've turned to smoking, turned to drinking. I'm perfect with my grades, perfect with my writing. I'm a fat piece of shit that can't do anything right. Oh god. I want him to punch me. Punch me so hard it feels like a fucking kiss. I'm only 14, and someone told me they couldn't wait until I was dead today. I can't wait either. Please help me. Please help me. I need someone to talk to.

I just skimmed over some other topics on here and the rules for a few seconds before jumping into this because i Really feel like I\\'m in full panic mode and my \"OCD\" is going off, so really twitchy and all that. So what set me off is that I\\'m transgender, and occasionally get episodes of dysphoria. What that means exactly is every so often there are moments of extreme emotional pain and its awful.I\\'ve been transitioning for about 3 and a half years and I hear stuff from people that have been transitioning for this long and that they feel much better and rarely feel awful and their lives did a 360 and its going smooth, whatever. And after 3 and a half years of this, there has been some improvement but for this to still be happening is fucking insane. This shouldn\\'t be happening anymore.So apart from that, its also around May, June which is graduation time and occaisonally you go on facebook and it is swamped with \"friends\" posting graduation pictures and all this stuff and after going to community college for I think 5 years, I\\'m 23, and seeing people doing that and getting on with their lives it is really toxic to see all that, also never been the most social person, basically a loner so seeing things from old friends who aren\\'t friends anymore and people being social and groups of friends and all that stuff it really fucking hurts, like a lot.Also been looking over other peoples transitions for the past hour and I\\'ve been making myself feel worse in an attempt to get myself to feel bad enough to kill myself, and I\\'m still doing it because like I said, I just want it to stop. And no offense to whoever reads all this but if you don\\'t know much about transgender related topics I dunno if you should reply, really, because honestly you might unintentionally say something stupid and make me feel worse, or do in that case, whatever works.',\n",

I was comfortable with this, that\\'s not why I\\'m depressed.I met my now ex-girlfriend in the library quad at my university. She was sleeping on one of the planter\\'s. God, she was very pretty, but I didn\\'t want to disturb her to make inane conversation. Luckily for me, she wakes up when she hears me rustling through my bag rather loudly (I lied, I did want to wake her up).So we strike up a conversation, and a month later, we\\'re on our first date. She\\'s wonderful, everything about her is wonderful. Her entire being is radiant, inside, outside, spiritually...everything about her is perfect. This is the girl I\\'ve waited for, this is the one God (not to disrespect any nonbelievers that may be present in this sub) wanted to bless me with.We have sex.

She steals my sweatshirts, she reorganizes my disaster area of a room. I clean her room, I make her breakfast. We even go to the bathroom together because we don\\'t want to be separated from each other for more than a few seconds. We take naps together, watch movies together, we cook, eat, clean, live together. She\\'s got a drinking problem. Drunk every weekend. I don\\'t deride her for her proclivities because my loneliness has effectively been killed, and I\\'m in love.With love comes responsibility, though. So, out of love, I tell her that I\\'m worried about her drinking. That I\\'d be upset if anything bad happened to her. She\\'s come to pick me up from my place nearly black out drunk before, and I don\\'t know how she operated a motor vehicle without hurting herself or someone else.This past Friday, she calls me and tells me we need to talk. I arrive at her place with her favorite foods: A large coke and a reese\\'s peanut butter cup package from the local gas station. I give them to her and she sighs, and so I begin to worry.She tells me that she\\'s feeling suffocated, and that it\\'s not my fault. She says she isn\\'t ready for me, and she drops that phrase again, that I\\'m \"too good for her.\" She says she needs to get her act together before she can keep seeing me the way she\\'s been seeing me. She says I\\'m right about her drinking. She says that this needs to be put on hold \"indefinitely.\"I can\\'t wait that long. Indefinitely is a long time if you think about it for long enough (heh, irony). She kisses me goodbye, and shuts the door on me.I go home to my mother. My eyes are bloodshot from the tears I\\'ve been crying. She asks what\\'s wrong and I tell her everything. I tell her what I said to my ex-girlfriend. That I was concerned about her drinking.My mother tells me that maybe I need to \"shut my trap\" the next time around in her own special way of comforting me. This doesn\\'t help. Not a bit.

Since my last course I completed at the end of 2012, I wasn't successful at finding work in my field of study.  Despite OVER A YEAR OF LOOKING AND APPLYING FOR WORK IN MY FIELD OF STUDY, I had no luck.  And I'm f***ing tired of it.  The only job I have right now is a part-time job at a grocery store.  I would have had a much better life if I had work in my field of study and if I had a better income.What's worse is that I was looking for a girlfriend for over five years and I had no success.  I never had a girlfriend no matter how hard I tried.  I feel hopeless knowing that no one wants me.  No one wants me for a job, no one wants me for a relationship, so what's the point if no one wants me?  What's the point of living if I can't find success after many years of trying.I think I'm about to give up.

I'm not technically suicidal because I have no desire to end my life. But I have the urge.See, I have really severe depression. Really, really severe depression. It's not even as if things are so bad for me right now; I just moved back to college after a year on medical leave to try to get my medication correct and work on some coping techniques, I'm living with two of the coolest girls I know, my classes are easy, I just landed a research position after only two classes because I impressed my professor and 4 days ago I had a really interesting conversation with a cute stranger and I got her number. Pretty much everything is going my way right now, yet as I sit here my brain is just saying 'kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself.'Both of my roommates are out. I'm sitting here, at my computer. The light is on, and the door is open, which is good, but it isn't helping my mood. I tried sitting in the backyard on our tree swing and having a cigarette, but I couldn't even stand that because I wasn't sitting in my room alone.I hate my depression and I hate my anxiety and I hate my obsessive compulsive personality traits. I hate the medications that I'm on. Well, most of them. But most of all, I hate myself. I mean, I don't hate MYSELF. I love who I am, my intellect and my charisma have brought me so much joy in life. However, I hate who I've become. I really don't feel comfortable expatiating on that with my normal account, though. It's not like i'm a bad person. I'm just not worth anything at the moment. I don't generate any positive value for anyone. I'm a hole my parents are throwing money into.I could keep writing, and I might if my attention comes back to it, but I'm pretty sure nobody is going to read all of this text so I just got really unmotivated about doing this.\",\n",
       " \" I've argued with myself for years about killing myself, but only recently have I been unable to have a good reason not to. I've argued with myself for years about killing myself, but only recently have I been unable to have a good reason not to. This is going to be a long post, if you don't care to read it, then pass on by, that's understandable. I want you to know that, while at this very moment I am not sitting here with any immediate intention to kill myself, I must confess that the idea has been on my mind almost every moment of my life for the greater part of a decade, but has become worse in the last five or six. There are things about me that I have never shared with anyone, not my friends, family, therapist, clergyman or anyone, anywhere, for any reason. Lately, I have cared less and less about continuing a life of futility. I have a knee injury that has never healed properly and I am left in constant pain that feels like there is glass in my knee. At no moment of a day am I not in so much pain that it is on my mind. My prescription of _PERSON_ offers no relief at all, much to my dismay. I have lived with this pain now for over a year and have seen medical professionals who passed it off as me just trying to avoid work.In addition to that, I have COPD and have a hard time getting out and doing anything, so between the two, I have effectively become a shut in. My family believes I exaggerate the pain in my knee and the troubles that come with COPD to avoid work.Admittedly, I am a lazy person, but I actually enjoy work. I enjoy the feeling of completing something. So, when I am not longer able to do things as simple as walking my dog, depression starts to kick in...something no one has noticed after over a year. My family and friends don't recognize my depression because I always put a smile on because I don't want them to worry about me, because then I'd feel guilty.But all of that, I think I could live with and be okay. It's what has been with me for as long as I can remember (around 6 or so). In 28 years on this planet, I have never told anyone in detail about what goes on in my head every day, all day and has shaped almost every decision I have ever made in my adult life. For the record, I am a pacifist and do not condone violence for any reason, but that is where the problem lies. I act and believe in pacifism, but I am not at peace.Every moment, of every day for almost my entire life, I love the idea of rape, murder, torture and straight up just mutilating people. I spend all day thinking about it and how to do it the best way. There are no exceptions, children, elderly, women, men, transgender, anyone and everyone. I want everyone to suffer and feel pain, agony and fear. At the same time, I want people to be happy and safe. I do more for others than I do for myself. I buy other people things with my money and rarely spend on myself. I am always there to help anyone I see in need. However, while I do it, I think of the best way to kill them or whatever else.I am so, so tired of living with this in my head. It is exhausting and I am so ashamed of it that I am afraid to tell my family about it. Everyone thinks I make things up for whatever reason, so if they don't believe me over the physically evident things like my _PERSON_ or COPD, why would they ever believe me about this?  I had found ways to help calm the thoughts down, but they are either really bad outs or not sustainable. Marijuana, I have found, is a catch all remedy. It helps with the knee pain, it is used to help with COPD and also just mellows out the thoughts in my head, but it is quite expensive. Alcohol would lead to a dangerous addiction that has taken my father and both grandfathers, so I refuse to go that route. The only other thing that helped was Cigarettes...and well, COPD, so I had to quit. This made everything worse.So, here I am, sitting here again wondering why I should keep trying to deal with all of this. I no longer have insurance and when I tried to speak of my issues with a therapist before, she dropped me as a client before we could really get into any of it.I don't want to upset my family by killing myself, which I think is the only reason I haven't. I am truly afraid, I think, that there will be a trigger where I am no longer concerned with keeping my thoughts in and instead they become actions. I am afraid of the person I may become and for that reason I ask...Why should I bother sticking around, in pain, waiting for the day where I say fuck it and let loose on those around me and am remembered only as a headline?TL;DR: There isn't one.\",\n",

Had a miscarriage with their child, baby's death supposedly caused by a previous suicide attempt. Takes blame for marriage, for being raped, and for the miscarriage and wants to kill herself as she feels she deserves death for what she has done.Since leaving her state she's lost an absurd amount of weight and weights under 100 pounds at 5 foot 7.

I\\'m slipping again I\\'m slipping again I posted here a while back when I needed to find myself again.I did indeed get better for a little while, while I was at university for my first semester.Since possibly about early december, I have increasing sadness in my life again. I do not know what I can do about this. My parents are leaving me with the house while they go on holiday for 2 weeks tomorrow.I fear I may not be able to hold it back facing 2 weeks of near absolute loneliness with me just doing revision and coursework. A bonus is that a friend is visiting me for new years eve, to have a drink etc.Should at least make things bearable for those days he is here.I just need someone to help me. My friends have, to an extent, told me to not talk about it with them. As I don\\'t take their advice so they have given up in trying to help me out with it.To me, I seem like I\\'m attention seeking for this, but I need help. And right now, Reddit is all I have.Without this site, I wouldn\\'t be here to this day. I need your help again SW I need your help again SW I don\\'t know where to start, with this.I guess I\\'ll explain a little about myself. Even revealing my name so that people can at least see me as a person rather than just an account on reddit.My name is _PERSON_, I\\'m 20 and from the UK, currently in my second year of a UK top 20 University. I also study distance learning at the Open University at the same time to further my skills in something I feel was lacking.I\\'m very selfless. I will give my lunch to you even if I haven\\'t eaten in days. I live for others to be happy and screw myself over if it makes someone else happy as a result.My closest friend who was an American national, studying abroad, introduced me to a girl way back in January of 2010.  We got talking and we eventually got together sometime in the February. We had a really good relationship together, she was rather sensible and had a good cheery personality, albeit bipolar from time to time.Then in mid december, the final week of my semester, I have two assignments to be completed and a test by the end of the week. I was consistently pulling all-nighters to get the work in on time due to unfair deadlines for submissions. Then she says that she doesn\\'t deserve me because of how well I treat her, and she feels as though she upsets me all the time.Now I have had depression since 2007 so it was commonplace for me to feel upset a bunch of the time.We manage to ride that little storm, and on new year\\'s eve, she commented on a status I had put for new years, replying to my american friend who also commented on it. It simply said \"I\\'m going to win that bet!\"So, me being a little curious, I ask her what the bet was.She was honest and said that she and my best friend had a bet on our relationship. He, betting against us, and she betting for us.I got angry because of this. Because 1, she never was very open about it, and had no intention of telling me unless I had asked, considering that bet had been made a week prior, and 2, betting on a relationship lasting or failing is just plain wrong.The next day, after new year\\'s has been celebrated and what not. I speak to her to figure out what the hell went on. She mentions that we can\\'t be together anymore. I cry and get upset at this because she said she just doesn\\'t love me anymore, even though I had given her everything I possibly could. I tell her not to talk to me until she has a good reason to.A week later. She begins to talk to me, checking up on me because of some worrying behaviour she had caught from me being around online.I ask her again why she just stopped loving me. She said, as bluntly as she had ever been with me, it was because she had never loved me, she tried to force herself to love me but couldn\\'t because she loved my best friend and was trying to go for him.I felt crushed, defeated, horrified, and just the worst I had felt in a very long time. The fact she then said I should just \"deal with it\" upset me further.I\\'m a person with a declining social life, and having this happen to me is making things 100 times worse. I just feel so horrible still to this day. It\\'s been nearly a week now since it happened. I can\\'t sleep properly. I\\'m eating at most, 1 meal a day, and just drinking constant energy drinks. I have exams currently so focusing on them is very difficult. I just have feelings of just giving up.I have had a dwindling social life for a while. I could effectively get rid of my phone and no one would know. No one speaks to me on it.I just feel so horrible about it all. I feel ashamed, angry, deeply upset and just so alone.I\\'ve just had no determination or drive to do anything of recent. Some of the day\\'s I haven\\'t even left my bed. Starting to get those horrible feelings of suicide and self harm back in my head after not being there for a considerable amount of time. I\\'m trying to get better, and get out of depression but it is just getting worse and worse. I feel awful right now.Sure, you might say I\\'m doing well for myself, because I\\'m at a good university. I don\\'t feel that pride, and I\\'ve never been able to. My parents simply did not approve of me going to university, with their old fashioned \"must get a job at 16\" ideology. I\\'m constantly reminded of it.I honestly feel like I don\\'t deserve where I am. I have nothing to offer what millions of others haven\\'t got. Apart for the fact I have never had a paid job in my life, because I took studies very seriously and didn\\'t want a job to ultimately cause me to drop a grade or two.This probably makes no sense whatsoever, but I\\'m going to post anyway.I have an exam at 2pm today, it\\'s currently 3am and I just have no intention of sleeping. I\\'ve been living off extreme lack of sleep in the past few days yet I\\'m not tired at all. I\\'m just giving up on the studies I used to find incredibly fascinating and enjoying, due to all of this. I just don\\'t have any drive to succeed in life anymore.I\\'m being pushed to the edge by everything going on in my life right now, being tested from all fronts, and I just don\\'t know if I can hold on through it. It can get better. It can get better. Hi all. My name is _PERSON_, and I have posted here before.On my way home today I thought it may be a good idea to help others and explain my story.I had posted here around 9 months ago, with the following post:_URL_ felt really awful about things going on in my life, and didn\\'t really feel like doing much about it. I just felt like I was going nowhere and I behaved as such. Isolating myself from everyone, not talking to people, acting mopey etc.After some talking with someone from SW and others. I had then taken the step to visit a councillor and try to see if it would help with my problems. Also around this time, I took up doing my favourite sports again (something I had stopped a long time ago) and began talking to a friend of a friend.As time went on, that friend become an important part in helping me feel better and be able to put that smile back on my face.On reflection on things. They have gotten significantly better in the time since I had spoken to the councillor and taken the steps to improve myself, even if before that, I felt like it was going to be a useless waste of time and that I couldn\\'t pull myself from it.Next time you think that things can\\'t get better for you, they really can, and your life can be significantly better for you if you take the time and the steps to help yourself! I cannot stress this enough. It was hard enough for me to just \"take a night off\" from work, as I was just using it as a shield for my own unhappiness even though it was killing me to keep working.Since all of those events had occurred, things have picked up so much. From talking to that friend, things between us have sprouted, and now we\\'re currently in a rather happy [relationship ](_URL_ wants to be a councillor when she graduates so I had the suggestion to her to help out the people in this and the /r/depression subreddit so that she can help people.

Need advice on how to go about things. (Seeing a psychiatrist soon) Well, I\\'m going to be blunt and straight to the point: suicide ideation has been on my mind recently, and while I\\'m not going to act on it now, I\\'m afraid I won\\'t make it to my mid 20s (I\\'m 20 currently) Hence why I want to see a psychiatrist. Since i knoe the suicide hotline wont do _PERSON_ shit forbme probably. Problem is though, I\\'d like to think my Mom would be reasonable if I\\'m prescribed medication. But I\\'m afraid she\\'ll flip the fuck out and always check up on me for \"support\", I don\\'t want her knowing where I\\'m at 24/7, as a matter of fact I\\'d rather have her out of my life the house has always been the most peaceful when she\\'s not around. I feel at ease. I want to tell her she\\'s part of the problem, but I\\'m afraid she won\\'t listen to me unless it\\'s psychiatrists orders.I guess what led me to this point is a number of things throughout my life. There was a girl in high school (i know. Teenage bullshit, but hear me out.) I cared deeply for, probably more than myself. One of the few I\\'d take a bullet for to be honest. Generally speaking. Women have always found me scary looking since my emotions generally range from,annoyed to piss off. But this one girl. She looked past that and saw and accepted me for who I was, despite me,being a,total asshole,sometimes. But then. I don\\'t know what the hell happened between us, all I remember was us getting into an argument than ending the friendship. But the more I look back on it, I didn\\'t realize how crazy she was and how much she emotionally toyed with me. Regardless, I\\'m far over her now. Then there was the fact I guess I was bullied all throughout my childhood. And raped repeatedly as a kid. (Though to be honest I even question myself from time to time whether i was raped or not since my memory is a blur of the incident.)I guess what I\\'m afraid of is being emotionally toyed with again. I\\'ve pretty much been abused throughout all my life via differnt means, bullying, raped, emotionally, etc.What should I do when i see the psychiatrist? Tell them everything? Why should I give a shit? Why should I give a shit? \"Think of your family and freinds!\" So? I could honestly care less about them, even my close friends, could even give a less of a damn about my family. \"You\\'re young still, you have you\\'re whole life ahead of you\" Yes, assuming of course things do get better, which I highly doubt that. I\\'ve been telling myself that for the past 4 years and if anything it has got worse.\"But you\\'re becoming a programmer! They make a lot of money and you like doing it I thought?\" You\\'re right, I do like it, and I\\'m good at it. However, it still doesn\\'t change the fact that statistically speaking, the lose of one person isn\\'t that bad especially when I could be easily replaced. Valuable? Yes. Replaceable? Bigger yes.\"But you\\'re unique!\" _PERSON_ and? You\\'re right, there is only one me, but there are more other unique people that are probably better than me with what I do. Uniqueness doesn\\'t equal usefulness. I\\'ve seriously just stop giving a shit anymore. All it feels like right now is that I\\'m just delaying the inevitable.

Am I writing a letter to explain people how I feel or am I subconsiously writing my suicide note? Fix me already. Some days I find it hard to keep going. My only motivation is to give people the opportunity to live through medicine. I often find myself wondering when the day comes and I save someone will it ever be enough to fill that void in my life. It is weird to think that a place of death gave way to a dream. The dream that one day I will be a surgeon. “Pippin: I didn't think it would end this way. Gandalf: End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path... One that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass... And then you see it.

No it isn't.”\\tI believe that the biggest wrong that any one person can give to another or themselves is regret. The regret that enough time wasn’t spent or words were not said.

His fingers were that of ice and his eyes knew that the inevitable was coming. “Hurry the fuck up!” I shouted at the EMT who seemed every bit of shocked as I was. As they were grabbing the oxygen tank I rubbed my knuckles against my dad’s chest and looked into his eyes and a tear was forming. A tear of sadness? Maybe. I believe that it was a tear of joy, joy knowing that his death would lead to such an astounding goal. “We’re going to Florida in two weeks, just hang in there.” I whispered to my dad as I got off the bed and looked around. I have often read that you can feel when someone has passed; it’s not so much despair as it is relief. A relief knowing all the pain, confusion, and unknown are gone. \\t“It’s your entire fault! If you wouldn’t have divorced dad we would have gotten him here sooner!” I shouted to my mother. The fate of my father was internally known amongst us all but denial had us believing that everything would be fine. An hour later we were led back to the consolation room. Feeling the tension and the amount of grief that was about to hit us I made a joke, I can’t remember what it was, but it brought laughter. Shortly after the physician walked into the room and said the words we all dreaded, the words that are burnt into my mind. “We pushed all the drugs that we could and got him back shortly but his body burned through them shortly after. I am terribly sorry for your loss.”\\tWithout thinking I headed right for the door but I was held back and told to not do anything stupid. We left the consultation room and went outside. I was approached and asked if I would like to see my father. I was given a few words of warning that I can leave and remember my dad the way he was. The door opened slowly and I felt my blood boil as I saw my father’s lifeless body. I turned away quickly, looked up, and clenched my fists as tight as they could be. The _PERSON_ station was in front of me and with tears in my eyes I saw them looking at me, a look of heartbreak. I wanted so badly to start hitting the station and tell them all to fuck off but I knew that my father would be incredibly displeased with that so I ran outside. I could hardly catch my breath as I called my mentor, “Dad is gone.” After that everything was silent and I felt my mind start to shut down and just carry me without emotion through the next couple days. \\tApproaching my grandparents at my father’s viewing I was overcome with sadness my eyes started to well with tears and I told them I did the best I could. I did the best I could to save my father. Did I, though? This is where all of the doubts come creeping in and engrave themselves into your brain and you can’t shake them. I was sitting in the front of the chapel by myself and I felt a hand on my shoulder. I look over and it is my mother. She starts talking to me and she says, “I miss him.” Yeah fucking right, is that why you divorced him? I told her that she needs to promise me to stop seeing the man she is. She asks why so I tell her that dad was the perfect person for her and she fucked it up and needs to be alone like he was. She says, “But he makes me laugh.” He makes you laugh? You have the gall to sit there in front of my dead father and talk about another man like that? I storm off. Later that night I let my anger get the best of me and I wrote my funeral speech. I was going to tell everyone that wronged my dad that they could go fuck themselves! Right there in front of everybody. I could hardly sleep that night as I was “day dreaming” the whole thing. I would walk up in front of everybody get on the microphone and praise my father for how amazing he was and  in the same breathe make everybody feel like they were the reason he was gone because of how terrible this last year was on him. Yeah, that’ll help me cope. Right?\\tIt’s morning, finally. Today is the day that I will tell them all off! They all were shit to him and they should all see what they have done. I walked up the church steps and stood in the doorway I noticed I hadn’t tied my tie yet. Surprising, I normally do that as soon as I put a dress shirt on.  I fumbled with my tie for a while and no matter how much I tied it I couldn’t get it right. I’m at my father’s funeral and all I am thinking is, “I need to be a man now and I can’t even fucking tie this thing!” I finally had someone assist me with it and walked away into a corner and shed a few tears, I felt embarrassed. I gather myself and go stand near the door to greet the people that are coming in. I see some prominent people from our town and soon the door is getting crowded and people just pile keep piling in. People were giving me their condolences and telling me how I looked like my father. Like my father? I am starting to think about my speech and how I am going to condemn these people and they are telling me how great my father is and how he would be proud at the man I am becoming. Fuck! Everybody is now in the church and we are escorted to the front of it. I glance back and see people standing, the church wasn’t big enough. If only my dad could see this. The funeral proceeds and it comes time for me to talk. I walk up and look out onto the crowd. I pull my speech out of my pocket and slide my glasses up my nose like my father often did. “Do I look like my dad yet?” They all laughed and in that moment I realized this is a celebration of a life not a roast to these people. “I have a few words to say but I won’t be reading the speech, it is going to be between me and my father.” I babble on for about five minutes and then I look at my mother. I see how she is sitting there and I think about the exchange we had the other night at the viewing and without thinking I said, “I know what the records say but my father died at home with his sons and he died of a broken heart.” _PERSON_. \\tI walked off the stage and sat down next to my brother and he said, “Good job man. You said what needed to be said.” Did I need to say it, though? I start to sob to myself as the music keeps playing and people are talking about how great my father was. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there are multiple people here who owe their life to, _PERSON_. He was one of the best I’ve ever worked with and he will be missed.” The funeral has now ended and we need to carry the casket to the hurse. There will never be an object that is heavier than a casket is physically and mentally for a human. This is where your loved one rests. This is death.\",\n",

       " \" i have given up on almost everything, at least that's how I feel right now. i have given up on almost everything, at least that's how I feel right now. I have quit school, it was horrible going there everyday while being depressed and all. My parents don't seem to understand me and I am at the point where I feel suicidal and what's holding me back is my boyfriend who lives very very far away. So I'd say I am not directly suicidal, I just think a lot about it even tho I wouldn't be able to do it. All I'd want to ask for here is some good words... I have been in meetings for 5 hours today so I really don't feel like talking about my situation more... I just need some good words to make me feel less like a fail person and maybe a bit more cheerful... I am always so negative, I told my mom that jumping from a bridge sounds more appealing than continuing life, why am I this negative.. I keep thinking that I want to die, but I know I shouldn't. I keep thinking that I want to die, but I know I shouldn't. I have people who love me, and people who I love. I have a long distance boyfriend who I look very much forward to meeting in probably two years. It's quite a while, but for a suicidal person, having something to look forward to is good, isn't it? There's also an event in May I look very much forward too as well. Also, next month, new season of a tv show I like a lot. See, I have things to look forward to, I have things that makes me happy. Like my cats, gaming, music. Still I keep thinking about wanting to die. I don't want to leave my boyfriend or my family behind, so deep inside me I don't want to die at all. It's especially when people ask me what I want to do with life, when am I gonna stop gaming all night, what will you work with, why did you drop out of school and what will you do now. All kinds of questions. I dropped out of school recently because it was difficult as hell to go there and I gave up. It's my second time dropping out, now I have given up. At least here in Norway I know I won't end up on the street, we always get money to survive and a place to stay even if we're unable to afford it ourselves. That's what I've learnt at least. I have no idea what to work with, I can't handle anything. I hate humans and I hate most things, and then I hate myself for hating all of it and I can't stop myself from it either. I enjoy sitting up all night and gaming while I talk to my teammates on skype. I enjoy being at home and just chilling with my computer and my cats. I know very well I can't just do this my whole life, no need to tell me what I already know. But whenever I get asked those questions I mentioned over, or I just end up thinking about them, all these suicidal thoughts come. I know that I won't live until I get old unless I get help for this, lots of help. I went to therapy once before, lived in a clinic for depressed/anxious/self harming/suicidal etc people. I applied to move into one again to get help, I went to get help by my own will, because I am afraid that I might end up killing myself when I'm at my worst, because I tend to forget everything positive and it might go wrong.Am I really stupid for this? Do I deserve to die? I feel like I do because I am so filled with negativity. Is there any self-help methods I can do at least until I get to hear from the clinic I applied to? What if I don't get to move into there? I am very bad at telling people exactly how I feel and I make it sound like it's not as bad as I feel inside me, and the doctor who wrote the application for me was Danish so it was a bit difficult to communicate too. If I don't get in, I don't even know what to do. I am just afraid to kill myself, because I don't want to leave people behind me, hurt because of their loss. That's my main reason to stay alive. Even tho I know I'm loved by some, I still have so bad self confidence... I can't do this life anymore, help me..\",\n",
       " ' Suicide all around Suicide all around I feel like I am drowning in news of suicide, and it makes everything so much worse.First big blow came with _PERSON_. Seeing someone who had everything I desire, money, family, adoration, so many people to rely on, take his own life hurt. A lot. If that didn\\'t make him happy, how could it make me happy? It\\'s not rational, but nothing really is for me about suicide and depression.The next two came recently. A kid at my old high school killed himself this week, and a friend of a friend killed herself yesterday or two days ago. I didn\\'t know these people. Last week, their names would have had no significance to me. Today, I can\\'t stop thinking about them. The worst part was talking to my mom about suicide. I think she\\'s always known about me struggling at times, but there is no chance she could know the extent to which I am haunted. No one knows, besides you reading this. She brought up the young man\\'s death. About his struggle, why he chose to take his life, how outside sources can affect this. Not being able to say everything I have felt over the last 8 years hurt me inside. I am too much of a coward to tell anyone. I\\'m in college. I can\\'t afford to be institutionalized or whatnot. At the same time, I can\\'t see myself in the future.There was no point to all of this. Sorry for rambling in this obnoxiously long essay. I wish I was a different person I wish I was a different person I wish I was better at other things.  I wish I liked different music.  I wish I had other hobbies.  I wish I had the opposite personality and looks.  I wish that I was anyone but me.  I\\'ve got to say, I\\'m not a fan of me at all.  Nothing is fulfilling, nothing is beautiful, anything that makes me happy is as fleeting as possible. No one outside of my immediate family really cares. Yeah some people would be bummed if I was gone, but after a week everyone would forget all about me. Anyone commenting here saying they really care is lip service. With the way I am, I don\\'t really blame everyone for not caring. _PERSON_ is my ideal human being.  I just don\\'t enjoy being myself, and I don\\'t know any other way to change it. What\\'s the point of doing something if you don\\'t like it? What\\'s the point of doing something if you don\\'t like it? Really, what is the point?  Not like a chore that makes your house cleaner, but spending your whole life doing something you don\\'t enjoy. I got turned down for an internship that I really wanted and am now applying and about to get one that I don\\'t want to do at all.  This experience of doing something I have no interest in will lead into my graduation, where I get a job doing something I have no interest in for 45 years and then I retire and die. What kind of a life is that? Why should I even bother to go on living if I have no chance of enjoying anything. I was told that my senior year would let me take classes that I actually enjoy. All of my classes are pretty awful. Boring lectures from a bunch of personality-deficient 50-somethings. Same as 80% of my classes in college. I\\'m not smart or talented or qualified enough to do something I really want to do, and my anxiety makes a lot of other stuff too difficult. I know a dead-end job and unhappiness is all I have, with a few escapes every now and then. If life isn\\'t enjoyable, why do it? You put down a book halfway through if it is uninteresting and poorly-written. I would like to put down this book. What happens if I admit my suicidal ideation? What happens if I admit my suicidal ideation? So I finally have met with a therapist and been diagnosed and put on medication.

For my next appointment, if I mention the suicidal ideation, what will he do?  Will I end up being put in the hospital against my will?  Will my parents have to be informed?  Will I be outed as a depressed and suicidal to my peers and coworkers?  I\\'m scared of my feelings, but I am also scared of the forms of \"help\" that are available. Not if, but when Not if, but when I can\\'t imagine growing old and dying of a natural cause.  I don\\'t think there is any way I don\\'t kill myself at some point.  I can\\'t handle being alive.  It scares the hell out of me, knowing how I am going to die.  Knowing it will be because of my depression and at my own hands.  I do not believe I will ever be happier than I am right now.

I have realized that life is meaningless through reading and writing, and now the only thing where I can carve out enough of a meaning to make anything matter is through reading and writing.  If I cannot create a living through those two things, I will end my life on this date. This gives me enough time to have some semblance of success or future success. If my outlook continues to be dark, I will take the ultimate step. I will remember this date.

My younger sister doesn\\'t do this. She\\'s worthwhile to my family. It may hurt at first, but there would be no one worse off if I killed myself. Everyone I know would be more comfortable and eventually happier. I\\'m a cancer that deserves to be destroyed. Why live when I make the world a worse place? Why live when I make the world a worse place? Who am I helping by being alive?  Very few care that I\\'m alive and very few would care when I die.  I\\'m a inancial and emotional burden on everyone.  I hurt my classes and work when I am feeling too down to carry my load.  I hurt my family by being emotionally unavailable and needing money to cover for my therapy and medicine.  I hurt my friends by being unavailable when I am in a mood.  Who do I help when I am feeling like this all the time?  Fact is, everyone would be better off if I were dead.  I am selfish for keeping myself alive.  I\\'m lazy.  I\\'m sort of an asshole.

It\\'s all I think about again It\\'s all I think about again I went months without thinking about suicide but now it\\'s all I can think about again. This sucks. Why does my family have to love me... Why does my family have to love me... It would be so much easier to kill myself if I didn\\'t have them.

Am I ever going to feel okay? Am I ever going to feel okay? It really hasn\\'t changed anything. Nothing has changed in the end.

I don\\'t think everyone feels like this.I don\\'t think I can ever feel better.  _PERSON_, therapy.

Right now there is only one thing that can surely fix my problems but I\\'m too scared. I feel done. I feel done. I\\'m not ready to kill myself but I am so close.  I\\'ve been thinking about it more and more.  I\\'m scared. I know I am going to kill myself someday I know I am going to kill myself someday It\\'s inevitable.  The medicine hasn\\'t worked.  Therapy hasn\\'t worked.  Nothing will or can work.  I will take my own life someday, and honestly it will probably be in the next few years.  I can\\'t handle this much longer.

I grew up with a mentally ill mother who told me all if her life\\'s horror stories before I made it out of elementary school. Horror stories that include her being beaten, raped, homeless. I even walked in on her trying to hurt herself once. She spent some time in and out of mental hospitals while I was real young. I spent a good portion of my life trying to keep her happy so I wouldn\\'t lose her. I\\'ve grown detached and resentful towards her.When I was in middle school, I was bullied. Girls would ribbet at me and call me froggy. In the 8th grade, I started smoking pot. In 9th grade I was molested by my \"ex boyfriend\" that I had dated the year before. I say it in quotations because we were only together a few weeks. My longest relationship was when I was 13. I dated a 17 yr old. We dated three weeks. In high school, a bunch of my friends continued to hang out with the ex that molested me and eventually I got to the point where I resented them so much for it that I lost comfort with them. In fact I\\'m finding that even now I feel uncomfortable around those closest to me. I thought when I went to college things would get better but they didn\\'t. The day my dad took me to move into the dorms, he had to wake up extra early to take my younger brother to the mental hospital. I was so upset about it, I opted out of all the hall bonding activities. Not long after my brother got out, he started running away constantly. Meanwhile, I was having trouble adjusting. Most days I didn\\'t go to class, I would just sleep all day and only leave the room to eat at the dining hall. I almost failed out second semester, but was given a second chance which I screwed away. I started drinking. Got so trashed a couple times that police were involved. I just wanted to be like everybody else who was partying and having fun and enjoying college. I felt like an outcast like I always had. The school finally told me I either had to go to drug and alcohol treatment or I couldn\\'t come back, so I went to treatment. I should mention I was also on several medications for depression and anxiety while I was in school. They tried adjusting my meds and giving me new ones, but it only made things worse. I would just get manic. While I was in drug counseling, I decided to go off meds all together. I was completely clean and sober for maybe a month. I had two months no drugs or alcohol. I hated treatment. I hated going to aa meetings three times a week and being told I was an addict in denial. Eventually the program I was in released me with a neutral discharge because I refused to accept my diagnosis as an addict/alcoholic. School tried to refuse my re-entry, but due to semantics they couldn\\'t actually kick me out. They did, however, hold me out of classes to the point I was so behind that I would never catch up when I was working and babysitting at the same time. I worked my way up from driver to assistant manager at the pizza place I worked after 6 months. I was drinking a lot less cuz after being clean and sober, I had trouble stomaching liquor. The place I worked at was awful. I saw 5 managers go in and out in the year I was there. The store was poorly managed and unorganized. I tried as an assistant but eventually gave up. It wasn\\'t worth the effort when the people under me made more than I did. A car accident left we with back, neck, and shoulder pain that made work more difficult. I was accused of being lazy because I didn\\'t over exert myself. Meanwhile I was the most reliable person there. Anytime any one called out or the store was in trouble I was there to save the day even before I was management. Now I\\'m working at another fast food place where I\\'m on my feet for 8 hours with a bad back. I\\'m one of two new managers and we both suck. We\\'ve both been there a month. The new job stresses me out. I work six days a week and I work weird hours so I barely see my friends. My brothers in jail. My sister is about to have my niece put in foster care because they can\\'t deal with each other anymore. To top it all off my grandmother and my great aunt who was the closest thing I had to a grandmother on my moms side both just died. My grandmother a couple months ago, my aunt a couple days ago. I also just \"broke up\" with a guy I wasn\\'t really dating. We just spent almost every day together. I fed him, bought him cigarettes, we smoked a good bit of money, I drove him around. I have bruises on my leg from where he hit me with his favorite piece while we were play fighting. I keep thinking I should kill myself, but I don\\'t want to do that to my family and friends because I know there are people who love me. I also do have the smallest shred of hope that things will all work out, but I\\'m miserable. It\\'s only a matter of time before I get fired from this job. I\\'ve already called out three times in the month I\\'ve been there. Once I was too depressed to go in, the next day I was too hung over and then my aunt died a few weeks later. I think I should just do like everybody else in my family and spend some time in the mental hospital to sort myself out, but I\\'m scared that will freak everybody out too. Plus it obviously didn\\'t help my brother or really my mom either. I don\\'t know what to do anymore. I can barely eat or sleep. I lost 20 lbs in a month and while I needed to lose weight, I didn\\'t do it the healthy way. I lost weight from not eating/barely eating and getting drunk and throwing up all day. I keep waking up with anxiety attacks where it feels like my skin is crawling. I\\'m falling apart. I\\'ve even thought about doing hard drugs cuz why not? If everything\\'s going to shit whether I\\'m trying to do the right thing or not then why shouldn\\'t I go out with a bang? Party hard and speed up the dying process. Fuck it. My best friend from high school got real bad into drugs. I thought I was in love with her too. Thought I was in love with another junkie after her too. Nope I\\'m not in love with anyone. You\\'re either someone to take care of or someone to take care of me and I don\\'t feel comfortable around the people who try to take care of me anymore. I don\\'t really feel close to anyone anymore. I\\'m lookin at a life where I\\'m only gonna get crazier. I just wanna give up. Why can\\'t I give up?',\n",

I just couldn't stop typing.I want to die.I’ve done nothing, and I’m going nowhere. I know I’m going nowhere because the second I’m put under pressure, I crack and fall apart at the seams.Everyone thinks I’m this wonderful person and all I can do is hate myself. All I can feel is that they must be lying to me. I’m not smart, I’m not athletic, the only thing I would even consider myself remotely talented in is art, and we all know how far that shit takes you in life. I love science, but I’m probably just throwing myself into a field that I’m going to drown. The study I love, Virology, means likely trying to go for a PHD. I’m fooling myself if I think I can get that far. Just last year I nearly committed suicide from pushing myself to try to be in AP classes. I needed to keep improving myself, I needed to be smarter. Instead all I did was fall apart and had to be taken out of all of them half-way through the year and put into honors classes. My GPA was ruined, I failed one of my classes, and the thought of doing a problem on the board in front of everyone sends me into panic attacks. Instead I watched as my smart, well-adjusted friends were able to pull through and do well. Now it feels like I’m in a different world. All I can think is that they must see me pass in the hallway and think, “Remember her? She used to have such a promising future.”All I can think is that they must feel I didn’t try hard enough. After all, if they could do it, why shouldn’t I be able to? I have lost over the years my best friend. My first real friend. She lied to me twice- the first time it hurt, but I accepted it and tried to forgive. The second time was over the same issue, and felt like a knife in my stomach. And she knows I have trust issues ever since my parents divorced. She apologized for it once, and proceeded to try to act as though it never happened. If I even mentioned that I had been hurt by it, she would get sulky and say she *had* apologized, even if I barely remember it. So then I would feel guilty. When I tried to open up about how I felt when I was sad, it would immediately turn into essentially a dick-measuring contest of who’s sadder. But I still remember the nights we would spend watching LOST and stay up late talking about philosophy and books and, well, anything. I miss her so much, but I don’t even recognize her anymore. I feel I could never trust her again. We haven’t talked in months. And I know if I was to go to her and tell her all of this- she would immediately get defensive and deny everything. So I would shut up. Again.Like every fucking day.I hate my body. I hate it so much. The sponginess, the softness of it, the roundness- it’s absolutely sick and disgusting. My grandpa keeps acting as though calling me an attractive young woman is a compliment, despite knowing full well I’m attending therapy for transgender issues. When I point this out to him, he simply says, “Well, YOU ARE. It’s not like I’m going to LIE to you.” I suppose I’m lucky I’m afraid of pain, else I would have started self-harming years ago. The thought is tempting though. Sometimes I fantasize that my breasts are like large, disgusting zits and I can pop them like one. Or if I take a knife and make a slit from the underside, I’ll be able to just squeeze out pus and blood until it’s all out and I have a flat chest. When no one is around I try to move my chest in front of the microwave as much as possible in the hopes that it’s not an urban myth and that I can give myself breast cancer. Other times I’m convinced I can cut off my own skin. Just peel it off like a wetsuit. More than once I’ve considered actually trying it, peeling off this female skin and being able to see the real me underneath it. There’s nothing underneath though but blood, sinew and bone.Then there’s the fact that though I feel like a man, I am not very manly. At all. I am such a fucking girl it’s downright pathetic. How could anyone take me seriously when lately I cry at the drop of a hat? I’m weak, into arts and drama and know nothing about fishing, cars, sports, and my emotions swing back and forth like a pendulum. The moment I even start to feel confidant and as though that doesn’t really matter… well, let me just try to quote my grandfather on that. “Dramatic_pause, you don’t know *what* you want yet. Your grandfather has been around and gays and transgenders-“ disclaimer, he’s the type that predates a sexist remark with, ‘I have nothing against women!’ “- and worked with them before, and I’ve talked to doctors too. If you were really… *like that*, we would have seen signs earlier. I haven’t seen anything like that, and your grandfather is a smart whip.”Great. As if I didn’t doubt myself enough.(continued in comments)\",\n",

Here is the direct quoted email:\"I enjoyed your presentation today.  It was interesting and well thought out.  YOu received a 15/15. I just wanted to check in with you about how things are going.  Your song topic made me worry a bit and hope that you\\'re not relating too much with Jeremy.  Also, you mentioned in class about your medication, and I wanted to follow up and see how you\\'re doing with that.   I\\'m not a counselor or a clinician, but if you ever need to talk I can be a sounding board and can help you locate resources if you need anything. Hope you\\'re doing well.\"I choose a presentation on the song \"Jeremy\" by _PERSON_ for Adolescent psychology presentation.  If you do not know what it is about, a 16-year-old boy committed suicide in front of his classmates.  This song is powerful and chilling at the same time and that is why I chose it; also felt appropriate for the class because many adolescents deal with suicidal thoughts...including me.A little back story about my suicidal thoughts...they started to arise in my junior year in high school, so around the age of 16 or 17.  I am currently 19 and I am a sophomore in college.  The thoughts started to appear one day when I was feeling depressed over school work and I\\'m pretty sure a crush that just broke my heart.  I thought nothing of this because 1.) I don\\'t have the guts to kill myself and 2.) I thought every teenager experienced these thoughts.  I have cut myself numerous times when I was in high school, but no one knew about them because they were on my leg.Also, a bit about my personality: I am very easy-going on the outside.  I am always willing to listen to people and I probably would describe myself as a \"wallflower\".  I have never had parent issues and they are really supportive of me and my way of life.  I have a decent amount of friends and I usually have normal college conversations with them.  I have one really close friend that we can share anything, but I haven\\'t had the courage to tell her about my suicidal thoughts.  I also have a girlfriend, but we have only been dating a few weeks so I can\\'t really open up too much with her.  She also parties a little bit; I don\\'t at all and have never had the interest in drinking.Fast-forward to now and I have started to think about suicide all over again.  The end of my freshman year was when they came back because my girlfriend of a year and some months told me she didn\\'t love me anymore.  I started to write poems about this and how I just wish everything would come to an end (I also wrote poems in my junior and senior years of high school with suicidal thoughts).  They really started to progress this year, my sophomore year, when I would be driving and would hope that a car or train (I go to college by a major railroad) would hit me and just end it.  They have been off and on for about two months now, but again they are just thoughts.The medicine that my professor was talking about was Celexa because I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder.  The first week I was on it, the thoughts completely stopped, but I was ungodly tired.  It has been two weeks and the thoughts of suicide are coming back.  They haven\\'t been extremely strong thoughts, but I have picked up my entire pill bottle once and thought about just ending it all.  All in all, Celexa hasn\\'t increased my thoughts about suicide and I believe it has stopped some of my self-diagnosed depression.Any advice for me to help controlling these thoughts?  I really don\\'t want them anymore and I want to control them before they start to take over me.',\n",

The fact that someone 18 years into their life is just gone. _PERSON_, like a forgotten memory. _PERSON_ have been organized by friends and family and my school today mentioned a passing of a student who committed suicide yesterday because of another person doing it. It feels as if this can be a chain reaction and I feel like it\\'s about time that I hop on board. I\\'ve been depressing for a while.

I still get told I\\'m a failure. My friends have to give me rides to their houses when I want to see them because my mom believes she\\'s sick which is utter bullshit. I know she has some illnesses because I have some too, but she uses them as an excuse. You know when you have to do chores or really anything that you dont want to, and how you start to feel tired or weak? It\\'s like that for her but instead its with every little thing she does. She\\'s gone to professionals and almost all of them have referred her to a counselor of some sort. She was absent during my childhood which led to my grandparents who are absolute scum, to take care of me. They beat my mom and her sisters and the tradition was passed down to me. I wasn\\'t beat as in like punched or anything. I was mostly slapped but they would ground me and make me stay in my room for long periods of time. No getting water, no bathroom, nothing. I would have to pee in empty water bottles. Not only did that happen, but i had a bed wetting problem up to around 4th grade. The doctors said I had an underdeveloped bladder and that it\\'ll take me a bit to be able to hold it in as I sleep. My grandparents didn\\'t understand that. They still believed it was my fault and they would scream at me and put me down to the point where i would pack up my things and walk out of the door. Keep in mind I was around 8 or 9 so after a couple steps I would run back into the house, afraid of being alone.Shortly after that I moved and it was actually pretty nice. I made friends easily and formed some truly great freindships. After a while I moved again... and again...and again... and now i\\'m moving again. Right before i go off to college too. Luckily because of my mom not having a job because \"she\\'s too sick\" i\\'m allowed to get bussed by my school since my mom pays no rent which technically considers me to be homeless. When highschool hit I immediately performed poor and now as a senior i have a 2.2 gpa. It\\'s awful and I\\'m ashamed, but i lack the drive to give it my all. It\\'s not even from the stupid things going on around me, i\\'m also extremely lazy. From a sociological standpoint it\\'s because my grandparents and mom are all unemployed so i think it rubbed off on me and became second nature. They only leave the house for groceries really. My mom\\'s had shitty boyfriends that have lived with us and ruined my life. Hogging my videogames (which are my passion and escape) to threatening me, beating my mom, cheating on her, and various other things. My mom has an awful choice in men and now she\\'s dating yet again so thats of course going to end badly._PERSON_, my father left when I was 4 which led to me being an emotional wreck that had a shell that breaks like glass. Little comments towards me drastically affect how i feel. I dont normally retaliate because i hate being mean to people, but it leaves me upset when i\\'m on my lonesome and ruins the bonds i\\'ve gained with my pals. Me being black leads to stupid jokes always being said. I live in an overwhelmingly white community so i often hear racist jokes. I know they have no ill intent but it still crushes my insides and makes me feel like a sack of shit. I tell them constantly (after letting it happen for several years) to stop. Or just not giving them a response. Yet they still do it and i absolutely hate it. One day i\\'m going to snap and i dont want it to get to that point.Apart from that i have an alright set of friends. Theyre who i always hangout with even though i have a good amount of people to talk to, basically none containing women. I mean yeah that\\'s okay, but none of my friends are sensitive or know what i\\'m going through. I\\'ve talked to the \"popular\" girls and such asking for help a couple weeks after we\\'ve talked and theyll give okay advice and then basically stop talking to me. They\\'ll say like hi in the halls MAYBE, unless they\\'re with friends. It sucks. I don\\'t think i\\'m unattracive or anything and i dont have a bad image so i dont know if its because i\\'m at the middle in terms of popularity and since i\\'m not a jock they dont want to associative with me.So yeah, i just want some help. People to help pick me up. I need something refreshing apart from the things that my friends have been recylcing for years. The funny thing is i\\'ve given them and plenty others advice in life. Whether that be relationship or personal. Yet i cant follow the things i direct them to. I\\'ve been in such a good place for the past to years but with the stress of not getting into a college even though i\\'ve been accepted, the fear of not finding someone, the fear of having to move again and not see my friends anymore because of distance when school ends, and everything else, i feel like my shell has cracked and everything is flowing back in.

I can't even afford fucking bus fare. My GF is seeing someone else and my heart is broken. I've never in life imagined a person could hurt so deeply. Nobody really cares about me. I'm all alone and the only thing I can think of is how great it would be to not feel this way. And no amount of alcohol or drugs can fill that void. It'd be better to be dead. Christ, I can't even go out in public without wanting to cry and hide. I'm stuck in this foul house, with foul people and nothing to look forward to, except a non-stop montage of thinking about my ex, and the life that I lost. I'm crying so hard right now.

I cannot endure this stripping away of my humanity. I can't even look people in the eye anymore. I'm better off dead than experiencing this final downward spiral.\",\n",

So earlier today I came home from a friends house, where I was greeted with my dad yelling at my younger brother over something, I thought a minute about and it was probably cause he never does his homework etc. Still it seemed pretty serious so I went upstairs and asked my mother about it, and as thought it was cause he hadn't done his homework. We talked abit about his low self-esteem because he felt stupid and such, but I thought no more about it and went downstairs to my room. About 5 minutes later my mom came down and told me, he came to her and said he was thinking of suicide. I haven't talked more with any of them at the moment, but I really need your help. What can I do, I don't wanna sit passivly if my parents screw up or something... I thought I would mention that last year my mom suffered from an inner brain bleeding and was close to death, if that can have anything to do with it... TL:DR Brother is thinking of suicide, I wanna help him not to..\",\n",

       " \" Here I am. Again. Here I am. Again. I can't stop destroying myself in my own mind. I wake up, look in the mirror and I hate the being I'm forced to see before me. Every last aspect of myself is filled with nothing but flaw and failure. In my head I know I hate myself and that is something that can't go away. I've tried. My brain loves nothing more than to critisize my every action. Linger on every word for thoughtful consideration of how unintelligent I sound to others. It wants nothing more than to see me perish a fitful death for such a loser. It knows that no one will ever love me. It pushes me towards death in the great hopes that I'll leap in a final act to quench my pain. The pain not only brought upon by others, even those who I considered friends, but pain from within. The pain of telling yourself that you're ugly, unwanted, unloved, a burden, a loser, overweight, dumb, and believing every word of it. At 17 no one should carry this weight. Why should I? I'm not enough. I'm never enough. I'm not enough. I'm never enough. I'm always second rate. My friend who moved in? My parents, sibling, and niece enjoy him more than myself. He gets all of the social attraction and I'm left alone even while I'm surrounded by a sea of souls. I thought I still had academia but that ship has sailed and went over the edge already. Another friend scored 4 points higher on his ACT and it's the talk of my school. I only have music left. My lone island. My only refuge. But it has recently come under siege. I feel like I have nothing else. I feel like I have nothing to lose if I end it here. I don't understand what's wrong with me. Why did I have to be born broken and scarred? Why did I have to be born? I'm just a waste of space. I'm second to all; even myself. I've tried. I've tried. I've tried everything. Therapy, positive thinking, trying to change towards a more outgoing perspective, attempting to be more confident, hell, I've tried half the shit people on reddit tell me I should. Don't be such a whinny, little bitch is all that I hear. I'm a loner. New people make me uncomfortable. I always fumble my way through conversations, even at work. I hate myself. No matter what I do I'm still not good enough for myself or anyone else for that matter. _PERSON_ in class? Could do better. 28 ACT? Could do better. All-State Musician? Could do better. Maybe if you did better you'd have friends maybe even a relationship. Wouldn't that be nice. What do your friends have that you don't? One's a fat fuck that consistently ruins your plans, but he's a social little butterfly that is happy with his new gf after breaking up with one that lasted 3 years. I bet you love hearing just how wonderful sex is and how you're missing out. Fucking failure. You're other friend? He's smarter than you and you know it. That lanky fuck runs circles around you in the classroom most days and no matter how hard you try, you'll never catch up to his prowess. Even now you try and impress those reading, how appalling. From me to me, just end it already. Even the girl who loved you, ah yes, past tense. You even ruined that for yourself somehow. And now you're all alone. Frightened, looking for help. Desperate enough to come here. You write the thoughts that are true for those who have come here to read but you wish they weren't. Pitiful. You're not a mans man, you're not confident, outgoing, intelligent, funny, attractive, moral. You're just the embodiment of disappointment. You know your parents don't care for you, right? No one does anymore. End it. Spare me your suffering. You won't let the bastard inside you see the light of day while you get squashed under the heels of everyone. You're pathetic. Really. I wish I could have been the dominant personality. It's a shame that you were conditioned into being such a LITTLE _PERSON_. Quit writing. Put your phone down and do the world a favor. Stop wasting resources that others can use to do something actually useful.With all my love,You.\",\n",

I've contemplated suicide but like on a minimal scale but In no way did I ever want to kill myself after realizing how strange it is that I'm even alive... I'll start by saying how lucky I am to have a family and people how love me. Some of you may not and I wouldn't know how that would feel, I do have friends who don't have parents and I can see that sadness sometimes, so I bet some don't feel like life's worth living. And some may also be dealing with disease and that's such a bummer but still some people fucking get at it and make life their bitch! When I watch cosmos I'm like wow, I'm fucking alive, I am aware of my existence and I can hear, see, and feel. Sometimes I realize my problems are just bullshit and I'm realizing I'm trying to find ways to make myself happy even with littlest things, I don't know I guess I'm just appreciative of life because I'm only here once and then that's it, so fuck that I'm going to make the best of my shitty situations. I may not be a smart person but I'm currently trying to educate myself so that I can become a better person and understand the universe. Sure it sounds lame but I at least want to follow everyone on r/science on day lol... Also if you have family or friends cherish them!  So what about you guys what makes life fucking worth living? I'd say weed too. Ahh good times, AND good times await I still have more time to make more experiences and new people to meet!\",\n",
       " ' not that suicidal... just need to figure things out.... not that suicidal... just need to figure things out.... i have thought and even tried to commit suicide 2-3 times. on the outside im the girl that always smiles and makes everyone happy. i can give the best advice but dont know how to take me own. ive made numerous hints even straightforward to my parents that i wanna die an i wanna kill my self. i overdosed 1 but it was very small and my mom treated me... i dont believe it was overdose but she claimed it was. i cut an i am tryna stop.... so far is kinda ok.  ive tried slitting my wrists cause i like the blood but either i didnt have the will or by some miracle the kitchen scissors to cut meat would not slit my wrists. i dont know if i could ever go all the way throught but it would be fun to see how far i go. i am fked up in so many ways. to long to explain if ppl are interested in hearing my story mayb i ll share it.  i may also be bipolar but my parents think i want attention. they have seen my scars from cutting and just tell me to stop and promise that i will stop. i have relapsed since i was 12 5-6 times.  i  dont know wat the fk is going on but i an getting tired... i tell my parents that im tired and just wanna sleep forever..... the dont get it.... Me and my story...i feel im better now though. Me and my story...i feel im better now though. My name is cassie, im 15. Ive been cutting since i was 12. Im naturally a protective, caring , and sensitive person. Ever since i was young i was always called ugly and fat, after hearing it so many times u start to believe it, even on days when i feel like i look good i refuse to believe it cause of how many times i heard im ugly. My mom is _PERSON_ and shes been through so much shit. Her dad was abusive, but then again we are hispanic and our discipline is tough. but even then, thats no excuse for wat hes done to her. When i was younger i used to adore and love my aunts and uncles...now...should my mom ever die and i have to invite her sibilings, and i see them crying, i will curse them and beat them. Because of one of my aunts telling a lie my grandpa (or the \"fkin asshole that should rot in hell\") he told my mom to get on her knees one day, and he put on some steel tipped boots, and kicked her back out. On her graduation day from highschool she couldnt walk. Hes kept her from going out with her sisters and so many other things, he is a real asshole. I hate him and he hates me, my mom, my step dad, and my lil bro even. My real dad left when i was young and he is an ass. Ya he used to pick me up and be with me but he was always busy with some other shit then instead of really spending time with me. he has always been a smoker and drinks beer like there no tomorrow... He\\'s hurt me so many times and has filled me with promises that he immediately breaks afterward and has let me down on so many occasions. He is the reason i started cutting. And to be honest, im just wating for him to die....he has lost so much weight and looks so thin, really like a skeleton, and im just waiting for him to die. Itz been 2-3 years when i havent really spent time with him, and i refuse to call him, or txt him unless we need the child support check from him. Recently his mom died, i didnt realy care his famiy doesnt approve of me, they call me fat and do not like that i dont eat spicy food. They also dont like my mom and his mom treated my mom bad. He guilted me into spending time with him.  He cried and everything i felt really bad so i had no choice but to be with him.  He\\'s even forgotten my birthday, and doesnt really even know me. The only thing i can thank him for is getting me into SFX make up thats about it. And i know people think its no big deal who cares he forgot ur b-day. But hispanics (or at least my family) are known for parties or b-day parties. and when i was with my dad it was because of my cuzins or families b-days, they never did things for my bday like for my family members.  I adore my step dad, i love him like he was my real dad! He takes cares of me and truly cares for me he is my moms knight in shining armor, and i tell him more than i tell my mom, i trust him, i really do. His family accepts me, but his mom and my mom clash heads alot. The only thing is they don\\'t know my name but call me _PERSON_ (not really my name, but close enough). We generally are a close and open family, but lately...I dont know. I\\'ve always been strange, i Wanted to have glasses, i Wanted to have braces. Something funny is when i actually need them my mom thought i was lying, i wasnt...right now my perscription is -4.00 and i have astigmatism in my right eye (kitty eye)! In my moms half of the family, diabetes, anxiety &amp; panic attacks,  low blood pressure, and chronic migraines.  Im already starting to get migraines and the anxiety/panic attacks but i just ignore the attacks and take exedrin for the migraines. But despite all this i sometimes feel really low, i call it cruising blue. Sometimes i have my highs and feel good, which is why i think i might be bipolar. i told my (step)dad a few weeks ago and he understood me, and i showed him my scars, he knew about them before, but i havent been to anyone to see if i am bipolar. I wanna remind him again, but because of money issues i just wanna wait it out untill i cant control it. I started the butterfly project...im doing ok so far despite a few stupid things i did this and last week ( i carved  a heart on my hip and butterfly on my upper thigh cause i felt guilty i didnt go to my godmothers moms wake ,even thought i dont know her). I have thought and tried to commit suicide a few times my mom even claims i overdosed once, but i dont think so. My mom is christian, my dad catholic, and my stepdad Jehovah\\'s witness. I was baptized catholic even though i know nothing catholic, only christian. I am afraid to go to hell even though i know ive done alot of bad. And i\\'ve made promises i wont commit suicide. I just sometimes feel so so tired and i feel like i wanna sleep forever. I need someone to talk to, someone to vent to i guess. I dont wanna bring my friends of Bf into it (althought he knows the story and has gone through a few of the same things) i dont want to burden them....',\n",

Background: 22 white male college graduate soon to enroll into graduate program with a job soon to enroll in masters program.  Allow me to say that i'm in no way afraid of dying.  The thought of suicide is very comforting and recently it occupies quite a bit of my thoughts.  If I were to kill myself it would be by either gunshot or overdose.   Both of which I have ready access to.  The one thing that prevents me from doing any arm is my love for my mom.  She has been a massive support system and source of love.  I would hate to disappoint her and leave her alone.  I have come to the conclusion that even if I stay alive eventually, when she passes, I will be alone.  In which case, there would be little reason to carry on.  This may seem shallow and selfish it weighs on me like a ton of bricks...  Apart of me thinks that if I went ahead and did it that I wouldn't have to worry about her, that her emotions are just a product of my perception which I couldn't have if I was dead.  I don't seem to get as much joy out of things anymore.  I've started to become burnt out at my job.  However I do still enjoy school.  Being around people can help distract me sometimes which I know is good.  I'm really not sure what I need to do.  It feels like I'm in a hole extremely unhappy. End of rant.\",\n",

       " \" Help me to help my son Help me to help my son First here is some perspective- I am 51 years of age and my son (2nd of 3) is 17- He is a senior in high school set to graduate in 4 months- Our first indications of something wrong came from the school councilor who was acting on advice of my son's friends- Our second indication was a call from the police at the hospital where he was being cared for after a call for help. (I don't know if that call was real or a euphemism but there were no physical indications of trauma)- I've been letting the professionals handle it with 2 notable exceptions. After the first incident, I had a very rewarding talk with him where he appeared to open up to me. I had 1 piece of advice that he appeared to accept which was - *don't tell anyone what you think they want to hear. No one can help you unless you tell the truth and talk about what is truly bothering you*. The second exception was related to some poor (my assessment) decisions he was making with respect to dropping a class a school. He wouldn't explain his reasoning and his mind was made up. I had a discussion about making decisions and explained that it was my role to guide him and if he is refusing to be led then he is forcing me to make decisions based on lack of information and that is never a good thing.- They second incident resulted in a spat with my wife and I decided to pull back, reluctantly.- That brings us to a month agoSo last night he has made arrangements to be with some of his football buddies for a party of sorts. He has asked for and received permission to stay over if the situation is such that he wants to. He's also borrowed the family van so that he can assume his role of designated driver for anyone who wants to go home and has been drinking. Yes, he was always up front about being at parties where alcohol was available and we trust him, or at least there has been no reason not to trust him. (Read:Don't like it but I've gotta let go sometime)So, around 2-3am he comes home. So far so good, he had an opportunity to stay over but made a different decision. I go back to sleep. 6 am I notice my wife is not in bed. I'll give you more point form as I don't think you want to read what's in my head- He's upset coming home- He reveals he didn't go to a party- Instead he met a girl that he met online in a town 1 hour away- He got a speeding ticket coming back- He knew he was busted but was hoping that I wouldn't find out- My wife is beside herself with worryA little more about me. When I was 18 and hosting a party at my house, I had an incident. It involved a loaded shotgun and were it not for the safety, I would not be writing this to you. As Forest Gump would say: That's all I'm gonna say about that. Further, my eldest brother is a diagnosed schizophrenic with manic depressive tendencies (Bipolar) and my elder brother has a non-diagnosed inferiority complex that severely interferes with his social skills. We are all above average in intelligence but feel undeserving of such. It is more of a curse than you know to be able to analyse things so well and self analyse so poorly. For the record no one can self analyse well, that's a trap.I know how I want to proceed but I don't want to bias the responses.

To know that I'm no longer attractive to her, that she would essentially decide our lives together or apart on a coin flip leaves me feeling completely abandoned by the only person I've ever loved this much. She made me promise I wouldn't do it, and I thought it was because she cared, now I just feel like she doesn't want to deal with the guilt and I don't know if that's a good enough reason to keep my promise.

Im so empathetical, so sensitive, so privy to others pain and joy. Yet still I have lurid, disgusting thoughts. And yet I revel in them. In uncontrolable fetishes, in murder fantasy. I broke into a friends moms house and stole her shoes and jewelry. Today I wanted to snatch someones purse for money, so I could get drugs to take me away from this world. I will probably still do it. And some how I dont feel bad doing any of it. Ive stolen from friends and family. Im a kleptomaniac and I enjoy it. Why does anyone give a shit about me? If they even really do. Why? Im a petty con man and thief. I wasnt raised in poverty. My family has wealth, yet I\\'ve the gall to squander my oppurtunities and shit on my future? I dont deserve to even be miserable and yet I am. Every hour just compounding pain. Ive been in pysch wards twice now. The first one during a horribly abusive \"friendship\". I stayed 4 days. 4 days of torture. No privacy, constant screaming from the other in patients. They put me on Risperdal, I think that shit permanently fucked my brain. Ruined my fucking mine. For what, for a company to make a buck? Is that all I am, a fucking geaunie pig? A fucking failed experiment? Well I certainly failed. Ive dropped out of college 4 fucking times. I have so many failed classes. The only jobs Ive ever had was shitty fast food or cleaning. I used to work at _PERSON_. When I had weed things could be okay. When I didnt every moment spent alone led to mental breakdown. I would regularly cry during delivery runs, or in the freezer when I worked inside. I quite without notice, twice. Ive quit all my jobs without notice. What did it matter anyways? They were shit jobs for minimum wage.I fucking hate being alive. I cant be happy anymore. The only time Im ever happy is if I can get high with weed. Look down me for it. Call me a drug addict, call me a junkie this world will. But I dont know a single fucking soul that doesnt down something to make it through the day. If I could just live in the woods and grow pot and food and smoke all day I fucking would. But I cant, because if I did then some fuckers would come up, burn it to the ground then point guns at me and shove me into a cage until I rotted and died. And society would be okay with it, many would even applaud it. A joke. \"Do what whatever makes you happy!\" Is a fucking joke. Anyone who says it is a goddamn stand up comedian. Okay. Sure. Fine. Want to know what would make me happy? Well I already told you. Id live in nature in the forest and Id grow a field of pot and harvest it. But I cant, so I cant be happy. Now go ahead and tell me Im wrong. Tell me that wouldnt make me happy and Im just ever so obviously confused. No no, youre right and Im wrong, because you said so. If you wanna be happy just get on your knees and beg the demon in the sky to grant you entrance to hia kingdom. Then slave away at a shit job you dont like to earn money for people you dont like to provide service you hate to customers you hate. Do it shit eater, go get your shit eating job and put on your shit eating grin so you can make it another day to be promoted to shit eater leader.I live in a world where our elected leaders control a large group of violent people that will kill anyone on command.I live in a world where psychotropic pills are shoved down the throats of the mentally ill and weak to sedate them and generate profit with little to no understanding of how they work.I live in a world where children are slain and raped and beaten by their own parents.A world where in my home country oppposers to the gangs and police and politicians, who are one in the same are killed.People believe in demons and gods based on fairy tales in a book. But okay sure. Im the monster, obviously. I really am because Ive never done _PERSON_ shit about it but complain. Never done _PERSON_ shit to help anyone else because Im a hipocritical stuck up close minded shit eating faggot fat worthless unfriendly slobbish beast of the wild that calls itself human.And now the good shit. This world is trash and so am _PERSON_ on a killing spree would be fun, in theory. But no, fuck that. Fuck that mass murder spree bullshit. Thatshit makes the world into the place driving me to this in the first place. So _PERSON_ probably go on a stealing spree. Buy a shit load of weed, smoke myself silly and then in a moment where I feel good _PERSON_ shoot myself. Or maybe down pills and booze. Whichever is more appealing. Im not long for this world. But dont miss me, Im not worth missing. Dont mourne me, my life was garbage anyways. If you do, then go take something you dont like and then throw it in the bin. Then cry for days over it. Become depressed over it, maybe even suicidal yourself. Then hold a funeral service. But you wouldnt because thats stupid. Because putting that much emotional invesment over a piece of trash in the bin is fucking retarded. So what makes me any different? If I werent so goddamn egotistical and self centered I probably wouldve already died already. I have to die some day anyways. Might as well deprive nature the sick pleasure of picking my demise for me and instead taking it for myself.Im sorry to my brother. Although you can be angry crude and mean, you genuinely cared. You really fucking did. You are honestly one in a billion, a good person. Im sorry I dont love you more to stop myself from causing you pain. But I love you.Im sorry to my past self. It didnt get better, I lied to you. It only got worse and I lied to your face, torturing you for the amusment of others.Im sorry to anyone this hurts. But theres nothing I can do about it.

I try to see that light in myself, and it's not there. No use for throwaways, I have to own up to this. I need to go to class. But I want to stay home and cut myself for hours. I need to go. I can't go. I need to go to class. But I want to stay home and cut myself for hours. I need to go. I can't go. Just what the title says. I have a test to go to, a discussion to go to and three classes to attend but I honestly do not think I can go. I have my _PERSON_. My various tools and shit for cutting. I don't think I can go. I will break down in class. I don't know what the fuck to DO. I don't want to die, I don't have the means nor desire to do that. But I want to do SERIOUS harm to myself. My cell phone is broken. No one will find me. I wonder how deep and how many cuts I can do. How many bruises I can make. Maybe I'll just go for the test, come home, keep cutting. And cutting and cutting and cutting.I usually am here to help people. I can't do that anymore. I am unlovable, weak, ugly and flawed. So ugly they are going to cut my face open soon and fix it. So unlovable that my boyfriend doesn't love me. So flawed and weak that I can't even finish college. I'm shaking. I can't go to class. I don't know what to do. I'm sweating and it's only 67 degrees in here. I can't go to class. I can't go to class. I can't do this. I am miserable, a failure an utter utter utter failure.When I smack myself, my dog cowers. It makes me feel like the worst possible person. But I am. I am. I am the worst possible person. I am the worst person. I desire all of this. I am incapable. I am unlovable. I am I am I am I am. I am disassociating. This aren't my hands, this isn't my fucked up, micrognathia-ridden ugly fucking face. This isn't my disgusting body. These aren't my eyes, these aren't my bruised arms. This isn't me. This isn't me that I'm cutting because it doesn't hurt. It's bleeding but I don't feel shit. I do feel like someone kicked my throat and chest. My throat. My jaw. My fucked up jaw. My fucked up facial structure that the doctors will soon nip and tuck and rip apart and charge me out of my ass for. Will I be beautiful then? Lovable? Human? Fixable? If they have something to fix, that means I'm broken.I cannot help you all anymore. I'm sorry. I'm useless. I'm sorry for everything. For ever meeting anyone. For ever getting involved in anyone's life and making it worse.Everyone in my life deserves better than me. Soon, everyone will find it. I cannot be alone tonight. I cannot be alone tonight. I am half thinking of checking myself in.I cannot be alone tonight.I cannot be alone tonight.I CANNOT BE ALONE TONIGHT. but I am.I chased your car down the road, barefoot, I don't give a shit about glass shards, about cuts on my feet. You sped away.He's gone and I cannot be alone tonight.It was a mistake. I got angry, I went to grab the collar of your shirt and I guess my hand or knuckles or something grazed your face. I didn't even know, I didn't even know why you were holding your face, I didn't even know that I hit you. I didn't even know.I hate myself. I accidentally hit the most important person in my life.And if I hurt myself to punish myself, it will upset him more. but I want to die, I want to die. I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared I'm so so so so very scare dI'm sso scared of being alone tonight I'm so scared of being tonight at the tone pleae record I'm so scared I'm so scared.I'm so fucking scared. you're speeding home in the rain I'm scared you're going to get hurt. I'm scared. I could never believe you that loved me or that you thought I was beautiful. It would be just my luck if I lost you. Because you transcend beyond anyone I know. I had something fragile in my hands and I threw it. And it's my fault.And I'm scared. I'M FUCKING SCAREd. I want to hurt myself so badly, i watnt to cut deeper and more than ever I don't wknow what to do I AM SO FUCKING SCAREDedit is there a chat or something i cant breathe i need help now right now\",\n",
       " ' Friend of a Suicidal friend looking for advice... Friend of a Suicidal friend looking for advice... Hello /r/SuicideWatch , I come to you bearing some news that may not be unfamiliar to you all, but nonetheless still saddening. I have been friends with this girl for 4 years now, me and her even had a short dating history. It has been roughly 2 years since our break up and we have been decent friends since then. Enough about us.I came here Tonight to ask for help. About 2 years ago her parents divorced because her mother was cheating on her father.  This is when she started having massive Anxiety attacks. Six months after we broke up she got a new boyfriends things were going great for them. Then suddenly he starts being a complete ass to her and cheats on her. This made her tip over the edge for a month or two. She quickly got another boyfriend. Here is the Catch though. The boyfriend is her mothers boyfriend\\'s son.  They were going good for about 3 months, then she was told she was not allowed to go to college because of her mom failing to submit the financial aid papers. This just added onto her issues.Fast forward to the last two to three weeks. She is now in college, but failing all of her classes. Her boyfriend is distancing herself from him, partially because her mother broke up with his father. Here is the kicker... Her mother is blaming her for the break up, saying it is her fault. She has said things \"You need to cheer up you are such a downer\", \"get a grip\", \"you need to be happy\".  Plus her sister is completely out of hand ( I would be here all night trying to explain what is wrong with her). Just last week we found out her mother is seeing another guy (The mother hadn\\'t broken up with the boyfriend at this time). To top it all off my friend now has Anxiety, an Attachment Disorder (Anxiety from  having no familiar around), and I say she is depressed. She is scared to tell her Therapist that she is suicidal because she will get kicked out of school and won\\'t be able to return.  She has told me multiple times in the last week that she wants to kill herself, but doesn\\'t want that in-between life and death (so pills out of the question i hope..)., She said she has contemplated not drinking water, not eating, _PERSON_ monoxide poisoning... She constantly says no one cares, which isn\\'t true me and three of her close friends constantly tell her that we care...which doesn\\'t since the three people she wants to care(mom, and boyfriend, dad) don\\'t seem to give a rats ass about her. She constantly says that each day the part that is scared to commit suicide shrinks..which scares me a lot.... Also, she constantly says no one will miss her when she is gone. I tell her i do, but she then replies \"You only will for a few weeks\". So what i came here for was some advice, for what I could do when talking to her... I really want to call her Mother and yell at her... she knows her daughter is suicidal... but doesn\\'t seem to care... I care about her so much, I have tried giving her advice from when I was suicidal...._PERSON_ had a good network of people around me though), but she rejects them...I can\\'t seem to get through to her...P.S. I am sorry for the poor _PERSON_ and spelling it is currently 12:30 AM where I live and I\\'m very tired...I probably won\\'t be able to reply till morning because i feel I am about to pass out. It feels nice to get some of this off my chest...Tl;DR: Friend has a pretty hard life, is suicidal, and I need advice...',\n",
       " ' Is there anyone? Is there anyone? I\\'m just a 15 year old girl, so I don\\'t know how seriously any of this will be taken. I just would appreciate some advice instead of researching the most successful ways to kill myself. My mother has always been physically (hitting me) and emotionally abusive to me (especially when I was in middle school) and she\\'s told me several times that I\\'m the devil. She tells me with confidence and not a care in the world, that I am going to hell. I\\'m closer to my dad and I\\'ve told him some of this, but I know he thinks I\\'m overreacting and he always sides with her. The times I have said that I\\'m depressed, they both just laugh and say \"It will get worse when you\\'re older, quit crying\". I don\\'t know how much getting older is in my future.I love people and I love the world. I mean, I look happy. At the same time, I don\\'t feel like I deserve the world. People do not care about me or love me back. I know I sound like your everyday \"Forever Alone\" teenager but it really isn\\'t like that. I have a very sweet boyfriend. I\\'m always trying to save my friends from cutting themselves and suicide, by calling them and always being there for them even at 3 in the morning. My own struggles are deteriorating me too, though. I don\\'t think there could be anyone out there that sees my problems as actual problems. I constantly feel worthless and stupid and that I will never amount to anything. I\\'ve been debating posting this for a long time because of it all..I guess the point is, I don\\'t know how to get help. Maybe more than suicide, I want to run away. But there\\'s nowhere for me to go, and I doubt anyone would come looking for me. If I told my parents I wanted to take depression meds or see a therapist I would get laughed at. That terrifies me. I want a future in this life, but I don\\'t feel like life would want me to. I don\\'t think I belong here.',\n",
       " ' The reason to live? The reason to live? Recently i had some suicide thoughtsNot because im depressed, but i dont really see a reason to live...My life is pretty bad but i always think it couldve been worse.The thing is, why do we live? I always feel like killing myself after thinking about what the reasoning about life is. In no way am i ever going to be resourcefull in this world. Because i know myself well enough that im a fucking asshole who shouldnt live...My mom always keeps telling me that her life would be better of without me and that i should slit my throat with a knife, and to be honest u really would but i dont even have the balls to do that... Im thinking of going into therapy to seek out my problem, but i really dont expect a lot from it..Well this is the end for this post i guessIf any of you know what is up with me or has any tips, that would be apreciated',\n",

       " ' i cant help it i cant help it i dont want to cut. i have to. i cant help it. its killing me not doing it. people think im a fake. i just want attention. right, thats why no ones ever seen the suicide notes ive written. seven, i have written seven suicide notes. my bestfriend rah, she wrote one, she brought it to school, she showed everyone, she doesnt cut. she thinks its cute. i dont. seven. the cuts i make are deep, and often. her mom commited suicide and she still thinks its cute....she doesnt know whats its like to go trough life seeing things and thinking \"itd be nice to use that to kill myself with\" shes a fake. the fake, shes the fake. sometimes i think sometimes i think sometimes i think. a little too much. sometimes i have terrible thoughts, i know id never do any of it. id think \"i have the stuff here to do that, i just have to find the right time.\" sometimes i think about the ropes i still have tied up around my room that i could just slip through if i wanted. sometimes i think im crazy. sometimes i think im alone. sometimes i think im the only one my age (14) who feels this way. sometimes i think , or more like wonder, \"whats it like, to be just a normal, happy kid. one without problems, one who doesnt want to die so often.\" so i try it for a few days but those thougths never want to leave me. sometimes i think why not just slip away in the orange scent of the bath, why not just slip off into the woods, why not just run in front of that car? why not? im just another problem im just another problem i see people post things on here. things that could help. and i think wow if only i could say things like this but i cant. im not good at helping. all im good at is making more people worry. horse shoes and hand grenades horse shoes and hand grenades thats what they say, almost only counts in horse shoes and hand grenades. so, i almost cut last night. i almost ditched school, i almost told my best friend that her bf is lying to her face *almost* constantly.i almost cried. i almost beat that guy up. but i guess none of it counts right? cause lifes not a game of horseshoes or a hand grenande.... really really i dont think i could really do it. i mean, i think i could. but i dont really think i could. thats confusing, i know, but  dont know how else to put that....i think that maybe, if i had the right motive i could. but that even with the right motive i wouldnt be able to go through with it....thats not much less confusing though is it? im not good with words....im not good with a lot of things.... myspace myspace so i was looking through some old myspace posts. yes i know what your thinking \"myspace *really*?\" but its the only way i can keep in contact with some of my family. and i get this notification about a comment and when i look at it, its someone telling my brother that he should commit suicide. and im just sitting there shocked that someone could do that when hes in that much pain....EDIT when i said something to them they replied something along the lines of \"go back to your hole you little rat\" my only thoughts were \"wow a disney reference...\" if you have never seen the movie ratatouille you wouldnt understand, the rats name is remmy and thats what my bro calls me got rid of the ropes got rid of the ropes i had ropes from past times when i thought i would really commit suicide. well today while i was cleaning ym room, i took them and burned them. along with a few suicide notes. i havent had any thoughts of killing myself latley. i acually really think i might be getting better. Should I Still Be Like This? Should I Still Be Like This? so my friend has this boyfriend...before they started dating he was planning to commit suicide. (he told me this after they started dating) and when she asked him out he felt like he owed her his life because he hasnt wanted to do any self harm or anything since and when my best freind set me up with my boyfriend the thoughts of suicide didnt stop. so is my friends bf hiding something or am i just messed up? (you know more than people think i am?) Relapse Relapse so after a little less than a month of no suicidal thoughts and about 3 months of not cutting i just went and cut. i dont know why, i dont really need to. my life has been pretty good to me latley. i just kind of felt like i needed to cut. no one would care anyways no one would care anyways honestly. my \\'friends\\' just laugh in my face they call my a slut and talk about me behind my back, they lie to me, they wouldnt care. my mom is constanly telling me to be like the other kids and that im not doing things the way she is expecting me to and why cant i just be normal? my dad would take forever to notice and when he finally would hed go out to the bar since he wouldnt have to deal with me anymore. my boyfriend wouldnt care he wants to break up with me and i know it but he \\'doesnt want to hurt me\\' any of the people i honestly care(d) about dont even remember me or they hate me too much to even say my name. and any one who comments on here i doubt any of you really care im just some kid on the internet. i think ill just go now.... _PERSON_ _PERSON_ my brother was in intnse care because he slit his wrist. we just got a call that he passed on.**Kyle was adopted and when my mom and step-dad got a divorce he went back to roaming from place to place. When he was a kid he ran away from his moms house, then child services took him away becasue she beat him alot. When my mom adopted him he was doing drugs and some other stupid stuff. After the divorce the rest of the family stopped talking to him and I am the only one who kept in touch. He was in and out of jail alot again before one day he just kinda had enough I guess and broke down. i went a little over the edge... i went a little over the edge... ...but i came back.so last night I told my boyfriend everything. We got into this huge fight and I cried alot which I don\\'t normally do. I posted a status on Facebook saying.....\"People would be better off this way. I wouldn\\'t be worrying everyone, I wouldn\\'t have to keep up my act. I wouldn\\'t have to lie, to keep secrets from the ones I really do love. I wouldn\\'t have to deal with any one, I\\'d be problem free and so would you (for the most part.) It\\'s easy. If you\\'d just lemme disappear. I wouldn\\'t come back to bother you after saying I wouldn\\'t. I\\'d be gone for good. And that\\'s the way it should be. I\\'m too much of a problem and too much for anyone to deal with. I\\'m sorry. Sorry for wasting your time, sorry for taking up space, sorry for hurting you, sorry for not telling you. Sorry if you miss me.\"I told myself before I texted my boyfriend that he was going to say mean things and not to let them get to me. I didn\\'t listen to myself though.So anyways...I told him I was going to slit my wrist and he replied \"Remember down the river not across the street\" My friend cussed him out and talked me out of it. Then he texted people for me for the rest of the night because I was crying so much. Sorry if this was a little out of order or confusing to read. I went by what I remembered first.TL;DR: Posted a suicide note on Facebook. Dumped my boyfriend. Took it harder than him. Had a friend talk me out of slitting my wrist. My best friend is amazing and I pretty much owe my life to him right now. His name is _PERSON_ His name is _PERSON_ When I first moved here it was summertime and I didn\\'t know anybody, until one day this guy showed up and started messing with me and my cousin. When I realized that it was someone messing with us I went along with it and acted scared. Later we hung out in the yard, we talked about random things. My mom met him and she actually let us hang out. I moved across town, but we still kept in touch. It has been 5 years since I met _PERSON_ and he has helped me through so much, he has listened to everything I have had to say, he has held me while I cried, he has talked me out of suicide multiple times, and most of all he has been there right by my side every step of the way. _PERSON_ is the best friend anyone could ask for and I think everyone should have someone like him around. *k so most of this is pretty pointless till you get to the end....it will prolly get deleted but oh well... thats all thats all no really thats it im done missing missing hello? my name is taylor, i was just wondering if anyone her has spoken to my remmy recently? she was supposed to come over today and she never showed, she also isnt answering my texts/ calls? anyone have any info that could help? please i am freaking out! no one no one no one is there for me...my best friend is going to jail in two weeksmy boyfriend is scared to talk to me bc i know hes cheating on meim blocked from suicide hotlinesim done for relapse? relapse? my best guy friend was supposed to be going to jail soon...but now its not gonna happen for like two more years and hes saying that we did all that work cleaning him up and it was for nothing. my boyfriend said he cared about me. and now when i want to talk to him hes no where to be foundmy bestfrinds dad is being crazy, this in cludes riding around on an orange lawn moweri am still getting urges to cut and always feel the need to hide my wristand im wanting to just fight someone. i want to hit someone not a punching bag or a wall, i want to hit a living breathing person. but im also beginning to be less and less sure what i really want',\n",

       " \" I'm afraid I've found that final straw. I'm afraid I've found that final straw. I've been battling suicidal thoughts since August of 2009.  That's when my _PERSON_ took his life.  I'm an only child and never got the chance to truly greive since I was slung into being the man of the house and had to be strong.  6 months ago, I started reaching out for help due to the massive swings in depression around the times of his birthday and the day that he passed (approx. 6 months apart).  I went to a counselor who seemed distracted and more worried about what time she was leaving than listening to me.  She was truly a waste of time.  I talked to my general prac. at the same time and was prescribed an antidepressant to help.  It did.  I don't really have any close friends anymore because I moved away from home after college and left all of my friends behind.  I've been here 2 years and have a few acquaintances, but no true friends.  I still talk to my mom and her parents, but that's about it as far as family goes.  I have a wonderful girlfriend who truly is the light of my life and I really think the reason I've made it this far is because of her.  Well, I made a huge mistake and I've really pissed her off enough that she just walked out on me.  She says she's completely done and although I'm not truly drooping back into suicidal thoughts quite yet...I know it's coming.   I may have just lost the one thing keeping me fighting and I'm scared.  No. I'm terrified of what's coming.  I don't know what to do and I'm seriously just sitting here waiting on those thoughts to start creeping in and start overwhelming me.  She's gone and I really have no one to talk to/confide in.  I've never posted here, nor have I really read these posts so I don't really know  if what I'm saying makes sense or if this is the right place.

Ofcourse there are people who cause it and people who help it but never enough to make it go away. I\\'ve posted in here before saying that I was going to end it in that post but ofcourse  I didn\\'t.. I didn\\'t take the opportunity when I had the chance.

I think it\\'ll make anyone in a slump, feel better.   I\\'ve been down again recently, and I just found myself having some pretty terrible thoughts I\\'ve been down again recently, and I just found myself having some pretty terrible thoughts Hey, guys and gals. It\\'s me again.I\\'m sure that you\\'re all familiar with my story, or at least my type. I have this tendency to get depressed around the winter months (though my blue feelings seem to know no seasonal boundaries), and for the most part, I\\'ve held it off this year.Recently, though, I\\'ve noticed some terrible changes in my character. I feel lethargic all the time, and it makes me feel as though my life is pointless. I\\'m in this weird paradox where I want to be alive, but I don\\'t want to suffer through the boring spots. I\\'ve also been trying to shed this whole thing where I put being in a relationship on a pedestal. It worked for a long time, but at least once every few days it comes back to haunt me.All of these things have made me incredibly nasty towards at least one of my friends, and I find that coming out and talking to my friends is as effective as talking to a brick wall. I have a feeling that it\\'s because I\\'ve got this one track mind, and it\\'s so difficult for me to break it.I\\'ve read a lot of different stories from this particular sub-Reddit where people are trying to get over relationships, and part of the responses is \"it just takes some time.\" I think that I\\'m just realizing how long it really will take for me. I wasn\\'t just in a relationship with my ex-girlfriend, I had a crush on her for three years, and I still think about her (though it\\'s getting to be less frequent as days go on).I can\\'t find a job, but at the same time I acknowledge that I certainly haven\\'t put forth the necessary effort. I know that there are people who turn in applications every day, and I only fill out a handful of applications periodically only to be disappointed when no one calls. My dad convinced me that I had a slam-dunk over at a gas station, because the manager offered *him* a job; but when he went to check, the manager told him that they weren\\'t hiring because they\\'re short on hours as it is. Need less to say, I was incredibly disappointed.It hasn\\'t been all bad being single and unemployed, though. I went back to school, and made the _PERSON_\\'s List last semester. I suppose it\\'s just difficult for me to put the good things on a similar level as the bad things.The reason that I\\'m writing tonight is that I had fantasies about cutting myself not 45 minutes ago. It\\'s the first time I\\'ve had such morbid thoughts in a very long time, and it convinced me that I needed to write something that someone would read and give me a decent response, and not just \"Oo.\"tl;dr version: I\\'m feeling like a great pile of excrement, could someone please help? An update An update Hey, folks. It\\'s been about a week (maybe around two, I can\\'t quite recall), and I just thought I\\'d write to inform you that while I\\'m in a bummed mood right now, I\\'m feeling a lot better than I was when I was considering cutting myself.I got a call earlier this week, and I\\'m now employed at the gas station. I go in tomorrow to figure out when I start working and all that.Also, earlier in the week, I started flirting with a girl that I\\'ve known for a few months who is recently single. She seemed pretty receptive, but tonight, she ended up shooting me down because that\\'s just how the world works. It probably didn\\'t help that in the time we\\'ve known each other, I did bring up my exes a lot. I\\'ve resolved not to do that again in the future because it seems to scare a lot of girls away.Common sense type of thing, but it took me a while to finally grasp it.Anyway, yeah, just thought I\\'d update you. The more I\\'m awake, the more I think about ending it. The more I\\'m awake, the more I think about ending it. That\\'s the gist of it, anyway. I feel like I can\\'t go anywhere with my problems anymore because I\\'ll always be looked at like a whiny little bitch or something.I work a pretty shitty job, dealing with swarms of assholes on a daily basis. That is to say, I\\'m a gas station attendant, and people treat me like scum. At first, I grinned and bore it, but now I dread going into work. I\\'m burnt out on it. I used to be polite and talkative, but in the last week especially, I feel like that part of me isn\\'t around anymore.It seems as though /r/relationship_advice was right about the girl I was crushing on. She was only leading me on. She\\'s probably spending the night at her boyfriend\\'s right now. She told me last night that she didn\\'t want to hurt my feelings, but I don\\'t believe that in the slightest.I\\'ve slowly turned into a misogynist, which I never wanted. Almost every woman I meet and befriend, I feel as if I can\\'t trust. And yet, the majority of my friends are women. I have some guy friends, but a lot of them are rather annoying and definitely overstay their welcome.I can feel myself becoming more and more antisocial as the days go on, to the point where my ex-girlfriend told me that she feels as if she never even happened to me.To give you a summary of that: I \"dated\" a girl I know from Canada for about four or five months. She helped to pull me up from my dark little hole, but then we stopped talking for a while, and finally broke up.She told me tonight that I\\'m an asshole because I apparently make it out so that my feelings are the only ones that matter, and maybe I am that way, but I feel so victimized all the time. I know that we all have to climb our own mountains, and I just can\\'t help but vent about how my voyage *must* be harder than everyone else\\'s because *I\\'m* experiencing it, even though I know that others have it harder and I have little right to complain.I feel as though I\\'m overstaying my welcome, too, and since I\\'ve pretty much all ready decided to eliminate myself from the gene pool because I\\'m convinced that I\\'ll never find someone who lives up to what I want, I\\'ve been considering taking myself out of the game entirely. I\\'ve been thinking of a whole variety of different methods, while toying with the idea of just seeking help from a professional (even though past attempts with professionals have been fruitless). I honestly don\\'t believe that there\\'s anyone who can help me, but I\\'m hoping. Hey, SW. I went to the Streetlight Manifesto concert last night and this song made me think of you guys. Hey, SW.

To medicate, like most people on here, I have turned to the bottle. Now, it may seem like I am not drunk because my thoughts are both well thought out and spelled correctly, but that is just a facade.

My roommates are in Japan and Hawaii respectively, so I cannot turn to them for consolation, and I don't want to burden my friend who had taken me to the ER 3 times. I honestly don't know what to do, because I feel I am a huge letdown now, and as much as it pains me to say this, I am considering not living anymore just to make all of my problems go away. I know it is not the route I should take, but I don't know what else to do: I have fucked up my life so bad that I can't think of any other options that would make it any better........

To add insult to injury, Reddit is saying I can't post for 10 more minutes.

All I can think about is ending things. I nearly threw myself off a cruise the other day. Had to spend half an hour convincing myself I had stuff to live for, even though I don't. Contemplating jumping off the balcony head-first right now, and fighting it is really, really hard. I've tried everything I can to help like getting fit, trying to talk to new people, cutting down smoking weed, and more, but nothing seems to help.I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm losing this fight.\",\n",

       " \" A Question About Mental Health A Question About Mental Health Hello Reddit, at the moment I'm in a bit of a tight spot and I've decided to write a text post on this site to see if anyone has any advice for me. Seeing as I cannot for the life of me find any advice from friends, parents or close acquaintances (trust me, I've tried.) So here goes:My closest friend is currently suffering from depression and severe anxiety, it's got to the stage now where I feel for his safety because he is regularly self-harming. Just this week he lost his temper in front of his girlfriend and proceeded to hit his head on the steering wheel of his car until he drew blood. He says that he's trying to get help but I have no idea whether this is actually true. Allegedly, he is currently on antidepressants and is seeing a counsellor.He acts completely normally around our mutual friends, he goes out drinking, he smokes weed and generally does everything that he used to do before he started becoming ill. He's essentially leading a double life, because on one hand he's severely depressed, and on the other he acts as if nothing is wrong.On several occasions I've had conversations with him about his depression but it always seems as if he's just saying what he thinks I want to hear. He regularly lies about his situation, acts like nothing is wrong and says he's trying his hardest to get on the right track.I'm at the point now where I cannot keep waiting for something to bad to happen (i.e. him accidentally killing himself) and I feel that I need to act. On another note, he's parents aren't aware of the severity of his situation and don't seem to be able to help in any way at all.Also, I reside in the UK and the NHS doesn't seem to have any advice for me, NHS direct just tell me that he needs to help himself and go to counsellors/his general practitioner but I can't trust him to do that.Does anyone know what I can do to help him? Does anyone have any experience in a situation like this?I feel out of my depth and I just want some guidance so I can move forward and help out my friend in the long term.TL;DR: A friend of mine is severely depressed and a danger to himself, how can I get him on the right track?\",\n",
       " \" I'm killing myself tonight or tomorrow I'm killing myself tonight or tomorrow I didn't know where else to post this. I'm not reaching out for help. I just want someone to know when and why I plan to do it. I guess when they find me they'll get into my accounts and find this, so here goes. I'm sick of living my life in someone else's control. My mind and body aren't my own anymore. Something is controlling me, eating me from the inside out, and it's so terrifying and I can't stop it. I know the only way to keep it from completely taking me over is by killing myself. I refuse to lose all semblance of sanity, and even as the second tick by and I type these words I can feel my mind slip closer and closer to my breaking point. I can't let them win. I guess I could make up a few reasons why I'm depressed. I didn't get the role I wanted in a play because I'm too ugly, and no matter what I do some kid with a pretty face and a tenth of my experience will get in instead. Everyone is better than me- academically, musically, and otherwise- and I can't do anything to change it. People only pretend to like me, and that make it pretty damn obvious that they don't actually want me around. There is nothing I could ever possibly do to change my looks, intellect, or personality, so what's the point?I just want out. I plan on going out into my garage and falling asleep with the car running. If that doesn't work I'll find another way to do it. I've failed before and I'm determined not to fail again. I'm sorry for posting this but thanks for reading. Bye Bye I can't handle it anymore. I tried, but I'm too freaked out. I can't let this take control of me. I have to go before my brain is completely gone. Sorry.\",\n",

I don't know where to trace my problems to, obviously there's something but I don't feel like I care enough to believe any of the possibilities. My anti depressants seems to make my dreams come more alive and passionate, but the real me is still unable to feel much of anything. In my dreams there has been death growing more prominent.

So she's isn't always able to be there for me. I have no friends in which I can talk to this about on a regular basis. My mother and step father kicked me out of their house. My real father has gone through anxiety but even he still doesn't know what to do.

That was enough to keep me going. Recently its been harder and harder to breathe, think, function. I can\\'t even fake a smile anymore without it hurting. All anyone ever says is \"she\\'ll get over it.\" I\\'m fed up and done with everything, I just want to end it.EDIT 1: thank everyone who replied, it honestly made me smile.

On November 2 I will kill myself, there is no if ands or butts about it. I\\'m needed now, if I weren\\'t I would do it today. My heart was shattered and the one that could fix it no longer wants me in his life. I don\\'t know what I do for people to leave me but they always do. I\\'ll help them out of tough times only for them to leave my life. So now I\\'m leaving it too. Maybe not wait? Maybe not wait? I\\'ll make this quick, 2 weeks ago I posted that after November 2nd I wouldn\\'t be needed anymore but I figured why wait. I\\'m a people pleaser, I\\'d rather see everyone happy and me on the brink of bursting out crying than worrying for myself. I just permanently lost the one person I would give anything for, and I lost him willingly. I want for him to be happy and move on but where does that leave me? I make all my friends so happy they all have needed me at some point but now..they all are moving on too. I honestly have no point to life right now, everything is fading away.

       " ' I hope you guys can help I hope you guys can help Hi everyone, it\\'s my first time posting here. I hope i\\'m posting in the right place. I am in a really delicate and uncomfortable situation and would love some advice from someone who\\'s experienced or dealt with this before.First, a bit of background. I have an old friend that I was kind to in high-school, because he didn\\'t really have anyone (there were some rumors...i didn\\'t take them seriously, and didn\\'t think it was fair. So I decided to try and reach out). Because of that, He kind of latched on to me and has always referred to me as his best friend. I haven\\'t seen him in about 8 years.  About 2 years ago he had some legal troubles (drugs). Which were then exacerbated when he fell asleep with a girl at a party. I assume they were both on drugs, but I\\'m told they both awoke with all of their clothes on, and he wasn\\'t aware of any impropriety. unfortunately, the young woman told the university that he had sexually assaulted her. Long story short, he didn\\'t have the resources to fight it (his parents died a couple years ago), and he went to jail for about 9 months. While he was in jail, i\\'d get the occasional letter that I would respond to (not wanting to be a jerk...we have some things in common, so I would humor him and we\\'d exchange fiction  and poetry we\\'d been working on to help him pass the time.) Now he\\'s out and trying to pull his life back together, with no money, no family, and a prized spot on a sex offender registry.Which brings me to today.....I pull into work and get  a text that he\\'s thinking about suicide. I have to go to a meeting in a few, but  as a \"Friend\" and a human I need to try to talk him out of it. I told him I had to go to a meeting and I\\'d give him a call on my lunch-break, does anyone have any advice on what I should actually say?additional background if necessary: Friend is in Narcanon, is not religious at all, is highly intelligent, and really really hates what he refers to as \"touchy feely, 12 step bullshit\" at NA.',\n",
       " \" Can I just talk to someone? Can I just talk to someone? I really just feel like I need someone to talk to. Anyone.

PM me if you can I can't do this anymore I can't do this anymore I don't even want to be alive. I feel like I'm unvalued by nearly everyone I know, and the people who are supposed to care about me only seem to make it worse. I hate everyone and wish I could just disappear. My story's obviously a lot longer than this, but I feel like the best thing for myself and everyone around me would be to die. And that my death would improve the lives of almost everyone I know. So I don't know if this is my final goodbye, but it's pretty damn close.\",\n",

But the big issue is recently i have been wanting to kill myself. The only reason i havent is because i dont want to abandon my boyfriend. It wouldnt be fair to him. I just really don\\'t know what to do. In general my life is very lonely and i can\\'t take beinng sad anymore it feels like its getting physically painful and my heart  feels like it\\'s heavy in my chest. I think i have friends but i\\'m not sure they really are there for me. And recently a very complicated friendship of mine ended and this other person just ignored me completly out of no where and i tried and tried to atleast get some sort of \"i dont want to speak to you anymore\" or some final good bye because since then it just feels like it opened up every history of being rejected and feeling less than. I just wanted to be okay. I know there is no \"normal\" but i know the way i am and how i react to issues and people isnt how other people are. I used to pride myself on being different thinking that the way i was fueled my artistic views but now in my 20\\'s im not sure whats real and whats not. Im tired of all the medicine of rejection of fucking up and failing and hating what i see in the  mirror and who i am i really want to give up and only my boyfriend is who i have keeping me and the relationship may not be so healthy. But if i didnt have him i would gladly go and never look back i want to go away and be forgotten forever because it hurts too much and i don\\'t want this any more. I hope i feel better, i probably will at some point eventually. If not i swear im sorry but im too sensitive and i dont want to be here any more. Returning to star stuff Returning to star stuff Last night i tried to kill myself with a scalpel from my disection kit. Ofcourse i failed because i guess the blade was not sharp enough or i was to weak. I am bluntly one of the people in the world who loves with everything in them but has never had that unconditional love in return. Not from my significant other, not from my parents or my friends. I have people who can be defined as friends but i may not mean to then as they do to me. I have developed a twitch recently from my medication. I thought that was the cause of what has been going on but viibryd actual cleared my mind enough to study and funtion but in seeing reality i saw that i was not loved. I always thought so but i hoped so much that it was a delusion but it wasn\\'t. I want the simple things in life. To one day have a decent job, have the gift of giving life and have a genuine smile perhaps once a day. For now i have scars all over my wrist that i will have to hide to not be judged or pitied and the knowledge of knowing that one night i tried my hardest to return to the stars and leave this planet. I hope you all have a much better time that i. I hope you realize that if there are people who love u love them back like hell. Love them as is you will never be able to love again because its something everyone should have and unfortunately there are people that will never know that.',\n",

I thought I was the biggest piece of shit, it has since been confirmed (an e-mail from my mentor)... A mentor of mine from high school and I had been talking (e-mailing) back and forth lately about my general discontent with life, work, etc.  I asked her how she would handle her son getting a DUI/OVI, and she felt the need to offer commentary on my life lately.  It wasn\\'t nice and confirmed my worst fear, that people would probably be better off without  me.Here is some of what she said:1) \"I could see the \"writing on the wall\" when you talked earlier about all your absenses from work and the excuses that you were making for not wanting to perform your job.  I know that I wouldn\\'t want to have you as an employee.\"  2) \"I feel that our relationship right now is very one sided and thinking that I would just wait for you to write again.  I shared with you what I am going through with my parents and you didn\\'t even ask me how I\\'m doing?  And everything that I read from you - or glimpse on your Facebook page is negative.  I\\'m not in to negative. \"3) \"You are not the only adult/child who has problems\"Then she signs the e-mail love and hugs.  It also says that suicide isn\\'t an option, but also that it is my right.I want to stick up for myself.

Bills and debt left behind? Bills and debt left behind? If I end it, and I have bills that are more than my net worth, what happens?  Is my family stuck paying them?

Thanks Reddit. &lt;3 I am so lonely I am so lonely I keep putting off homework, it just feels so pointless. I live with my parents but don\\'t really talk to them or my siblings. They are just always busy and I don\\'t want to bother them.The last 2 years or so I have had a friend (whom I met online) who I told everything too. I always had someone to go to, someone who encouraged me. Unfortunately the friendship ended about a month and a half ago. (We had a fight. I said things I can never take back)Now I am just feeling really lonely. Like I am by myself in this world. No one to talk to, no one to tell me I shouldn\\'t kill myself. No one to get me to work on my HW so I don\\'t flunk out of college.I know this probably isn\\'t something I should be relying on someone else for, but I just can\\'t keep going by myself. I can\\'t stay motivated. I keep wanting to just do nothing all day.People who I have talked to on Reddit have been nice, but that only works for a few days until I feel bad for bothering them. I just wish I had someone who I could depend on to talk to when I need it.I keep staying up late because I don\\'t want tomorrow to get here. I keep hoping I never wake up. I keep hoping I will get poisoned or something and die. I really want to die. I don\\'t want to live. It doesn\\'t seam worth it. It\\'s to hard. It hurts to much. I\\'m so lonely. I feel so alone.I know my parents love me, but this is just so hard.You may call me \"selfish\" or \"a coward,\" but this is how I feel.People die and commit suicide all the time, it just makes my life seem so worthless. Death happens so much, what\\'s wrong with bringing it upon myself?(Ps. sorry this post is all over the place; I am a wreck right now.) Tonight may be the night... Tonight may be the night... I just don\\'t want to do this anymore..My mind is lying to me tonight and in a very bad state.I have no rational thinking ability. I feel like it\\'s time that I stop putting off suicide.I know tomorrow I would feel much better.. but I just don\\'t want to be alive tomorrow.So many failures.... so much I\\'m not good at... so few things I am good at..I just want this pointlessness to end.Edit: I\\'m going to sleep. Edit 2: well sleep was a cool idea anyway.. I don\\'t want to anymore. Why do I even try? I don\\'t want to anymore. Why do I even try? This semester started out great... I was happy, I was keeping ahead of things. Then I started to lose interest (as always.)Started to put things off like I always do. But things were still going okay.. I was making a new friend for the first time since like.. ever.This classmate and I are in a coding contest together (due in January.) I was really excited because I figured she would keep me interested in this contest and I would stay motivated (adhd == hard to stay motivated/follow through with things.)Anyway, a few weeks ago she started being really distant, and kind of bitchy. I don\\'t know why...maybe she\\'s busy, maybe something happened in her life, maybe I did something wrong.In any case, I feel like complete shit.... she just got mad at me because I keep changing my mind on stuff (mood swings yo.)And now the feelings of suicide that have been coming back for the past month are hitting me HARD. I just don\\'t want to go to class tomorrow... I don\\'t want to be alive tomorrow... I want to die....badly.I\\'m not on any meds or even caffeine that would make me feel this way.. I\\'m just fucked up and hate myself.I hate my ADHD. I can\\'t seem to complete anything unless it takes 5 minutes or less. I hate it all. I hate the world. I hate myself.:\\'(/rantedit:I also feel like shit because I\\'m looking to her for motivation which I know is a bad idea and never works out, and even if she were to try to help it would be too draining on her and she would still eventually end up being distant (as would anyone.)I went into this semester knowing I need to put on a personality of being confident and happy all the time. I\\'m failing at that, and it looks like the one friend I might have been making is being driven away by it.Edit2:I\\'ve calmed down... But everything in the post is still true. I just don\\'t think I\\'ll ever amount to much. ADHD is preventing me from accomplishing anything. I just don\\'t think I\\'ll ever amount to much. ADHD is preventing me from accomplishing anything. Just want to end it all. I feel alone. I\\'ll never accomplish the things I want to because of fucking ADHD. (yes I\\'m on meds for it.)Fuck. Just wish someone would kill me or something. I really don\\'t want to wake up tomorrow. Fuck. I hate myself. I hate the way I am. I hate how I am never able to make friends because I never care enough to try.Just want it all to end.

They have done so much to support me through all of this and I just can't find a way to express myself so I guess this is me trying to find a way to open so this will probably turn out very rambling and poorly punctuated and for that I apologize in advance.Ok so I really enjoy my degree it's awesome but I've been miserable here since the day I first started. OVer the course of my 3 years I have systimatically destroyed or alienated myself from pretty much everyone I beame freinds with. I can't explain this other than have real abandonment issues due to leaving home at 17 because I simply couldn't get along with my parents and they asked me to leave home. I guess I've never gotten over this despite the fact in recent years I have developed a good relationship with my mum and an ok(ish) one with my dad and they are both very supportive.At uni I feel really isolated and alone and this eats me up mainly because I know that deep down part of the reason I am alone is due to my own self destructive behaviors and the way they drive the people in my life away.So now we're getting to the end of the 3rd year of university and my friends (what ones I have left) are all graduating and so is my gf. This has been worrying me because I've barely coped this year with them around and I have no clue how I'm going to survive my last year without them. Anyway on the day in question I just couldn't face it anymore I got up I packed my things and I left my gf's like any other day when I went home to go play video games only today I didn't.Instead I went to the park I sat in the sun texted the people I loved to tell them that I loved them then I took my entire months supply of lithium in one go. after a while i started to panic and I knew I had to make sure my brother knew I lvoed him and that I was sorry (at this point he was the only one I hadn't spoken to as he was at work) as time went on I panicked that there was no way that I could leave the world without him knowing how much I cared.one thing led to another and I ended up in hospital with my gf trying to comfort me as I was vomiting and had diarrhea for hours. Man I never thought it would end there was just more and more and more. After 18 hours of laxatives being fed to me to flush my system my lithium levels showed I was bewlow a dangerous point but ahd to stay in hospital until the psych team could get a cnosult to me. I was eventually discharged without having to be admitted to the psych unit YAY!!!!!However now role on two weeks of me snapping at the GF who I love with all my heart being unable to to talk to the friends I have left and being horribly uncomfortable in peoples company but even more uncomfortable in just my own and shes back in Denmark.I can't sleep because everytime I close my eyes I'm scared that I'm going to open them and I'm going to be back in that hospital in the psych unit and I've just been dreaming they let me go, I';m having 4-5 panic attacks ona daily basis and even when I do sleep I wake up panicked due to panic attacks in my dreams that the spread over into real panic attacks. Right now I'm really scared I've wanted to hurt myself before but never to just destroy myself and I'm scared I'm goig to end up right back there and I just don't know what to do.Oh and yes I'm now in contact with my local mental health team and am on the waiting list for access to a community psychiatric nurse but the waiting list is 3 months and I'll be back at uni by then.edit edit for typos _PERSON_ probably missed some but I had 3 panic attacks and a crying spell whilst writing this.\",\n",

I have been in the gifted program (PEGS/Rainbows/GATE or whatever they call it now of days) since I was litle. I was bullied constantly as a kid, I was babied by my adoptive mother up until the 4th grade when she had her stroke(she bathed me even) she babied me because her daughter had died 10 years before I was born and given to her through an in family adoption. It was complicated and jacked with my head, nearly bombshelling my social skills with anyone below the age of 30. I never have really found my niche but now I have caught myself in alot. I now have no job, alot of issues with the people I call friends, trouble with my faith (I\\'ve been planning to go into ministry to help people. I just finsihed my previous semester with some of the hardest courses with a 1.1 GPA so basically failed everything. I don\\'t know what to do anymore. Im scared at what my \"life is going to become. I have left out a ton of other things, deaths strokes, other family but I just am in a bad state of mind after I just blew up on my only friends I really have had left. I sought help, and it didn\\'t do it. I sought help, and it didn\\'t do it. I have been out of school for somewhere around 40% of this year. Last semester failed 6 of my 8 classes. I have a 34 on my ACT. I have had low grades in classes for years. I am a christian, but this is the longest I\\'ve ever been out. I hurt constantly in my abdomen but all tests come back negative. I have had no one check on me, or question my well being. I had a bought of new suicidal thoughts back in september for the first time, and I knew I needed help. The psychiatrist is doing things but said with my brain, even failing high school I could do anything. But I still dont see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have leadership roles, I am a mentor to the Freshman at my high school, and am planning on going into ministry, but I just can\\'t fucking do it. I dont have any friends who actually care, just forced by teams or organizations or churches. I dont have a girlfriend. My adoptive parents are too racist hateful old bikers and I have been lying to my bio mom who only cares about my good grades saying things are fine so I cant turn to her, and I\\'m now back here. I thought for a while and the only reason I couldn\\'t come to terms with suicide is the suicide note would take too long to write, not leaving a person out of it, and the girlfriend who recently broke up with me would probably feel at guilt along with other people, and I don\\'t want them too think they are at fault.

I think to go and help them in their dimension. I\\'m really lonely. It\\'s lonely hearing voices. I\\'m scared. I don\\'t want to do this anymore. I\\'m diagnosed with schizophrenia. I don\\'t really know if the doctor was telling me the truth, but the people I trust tell me they agree. I have an unsupportive mother, but sometimes she can be supportive. Not often. My sister is good. People would be hurt and said if I died and I really wanna stick around and watch my nephew who I love with all my heart grow up. But the voices won\\'t quit. And I don\\'t know how much longer I will last like this. I want to help them as they keep telling me to do, but I have to kill myself to do it. It\\'s like a greater calling, like I\\'m destined to do more than live in this dimension. I have to die and travel and help people because I\\'m the only one that can hear them. But at the same time, I love my friends, even when they can\\'t make time for me, and I love my family, even if they can be extremely screwed up. I just don\\'t know what to do. I see my therapist tomorrow, and I will talk to him, but I know he is already extremely concerned about me since I stopped taking my medication and I\\'m afraid he\\'ll hospitalize me, which will go over very badly with both my mother and sister. I don\\'t know if I can handle that. I feel like I don\\'t have a future anymore I feel like I don\\'t have a future anymore A few weeks ago I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, after having symptoms since the end of last year. I don\\'t know what to believe anymore. Some days it\\'s easier to believe that I\\'m just sick and all the beliefs I get about the world and other people, and the voices I hear, are just part of it. But most days I get sucked in, I can\\'t stop thinking about these other worlds(dimensions) and people watching me, judging me, that people in another dimension need my help and I have to kill myself to get to them because that\\'s what they keep telling me to do. I had to stop working, because I was hospitalized for getting really suicidal and psychotic. The hospital is where I got diagnosed. I\\'m off meds currently because I couldn\\'t stand the side effects of them so i just stopped, about two and a half weeks ago or so. I just started working again, only 3 days a week at a web design company. I don\\'t know what I want to do with the rest of my life. I feel broken. I was so sure I was going to get into making websites and stuff, and I feel like I want to know more, I know html and just looking at code makes me feel good because I love that I can understand it when I remember so clearly a time when I thought it was the most difficult thing ever and it all looked like an alien language. So I guess I\\'m proud of myself for learning it, even though it wasn\\'t that hard and it\\'s not a big thing. I just like that I can make sense of something that I couldn\\'t before. So that\\'s one good thing. I used to draw a lot. Now I don\\'t. I just kinda fell out of it, from being sick. I feel stuck. I was sexually abused as a kid. And that factors into some of my \"delusions\", well, it\\'s one of my beliefs that I don\\'t really talk about because the one person I told assured me it wasn\\'t real. But it haunts me. It hurts so much. I\\'m alone and I\\'m worthless and I feel like I\\'m never going to be as special as I felt when I was a kid getting a bunch of attention from this pedophile I though was my friend. I feel like I\\'ve lost myself this year. I don\\'t know what to do anymore. I don\\'t know what kind of future I see when sometimes it\\'s so hard to focus and think and I feel so stupid. The best thing in my life is my nephew. He\\'s the #1 reason I don\\'t kill myself. Because if I can\\'t be sure of anything, and I don\\'t know if this is reality anymore, and everything is fucked. I know he\\'s real, because I\\'ve watched him grow up, and he\\'s almost a kid, and it\\'s amazing seeing him learn and change and I\\'m scared to go and lose seeing more of that. But at the same time I\\'m through with being hurt and sad and my brain not working, I\\'m through with questioning every gorram thing and every person that looks at me. it\\'s exhausting. It\\'s so lonely to hear voices telling me that they need my help and I have to kill myself and nobody seems to care or understand it. Anyone have any idea what I\\'m supposed to do next? It\\'s either kill myself or find something meaningful to do for myself and I\\'m lost about it. It doesn\\'t seem like there\\'s anything I can do to escape this. Schizophrenia is sort of a lifelong thing. There\\'s no escaping. If I don\\'t get housing next week I\\'m offing myself. If I don\\'t get housing next week I\\'m offing myself. I\\'m schizophrenic. Gonna go off meds soon. I hate them. They\\'re wrong. I was just molested on the bus(reported it). Felt like my childhood sexual abuse. I\\'m just done. My brain isn\\'t working anymore. Starting to see things in addition to hearing voices. Fuck it. It\\'s important that I die. Everyone will be better off without me. This time next week I\\'ll know whether or not I got the housing that I was waiting for to be in a sober living home so I can finally get out of my mom\\'s house. If I don\\'t get it I\\'m done. I can\\'t be here anymore.This housing is the only hope I have for a better future. It\\'s too confusing. Too scary. My mind is broken. It\\'s too confusing. Too scary. My mind is broken. I\\'m so tired of not knowing what is real. I\\'m 22 and a diagnosed schizophrenic. I miss my voices. The meds made them go away. I don\\'t even know what they mean anymore. Were they just tricking me? I wanna scream so much. I hate myself. The meds made me fat and ugly and now my family hates me. The want me to die. They don\\'t want an ugly daughter.I feel so alone. I have blades. And alcohol. I could just get drunk, cut away the suffering and get to be free. I wanna go off my meds and kill myself I wanna go off my meds and kill myself I\\'m schizophrenic. And tired. My meds make me sick to my stomach and tired but they\\'re the only ones that work. I\\'m torn between even wanting them to work and wanting them to fail.I still want to hear voices. They have important messages for me that no one believes in. But I do. And I need to her them. Last they told me was to kill myself, that my meds were poison and that I am their savior.I have to kill myself soon. Dunno how soon. But I have to do it. I want to cut so badly. Maybe I will. But I don\\'t want to risk going to a mental hospital before I commit suicide.So goodbye, \\'verse. Soon I\\'ll be gone. I\\'m thinking by the end of the month. I\\'m losing my gorram mind. I\\'m losing my gorram mind. Fraking help me. My family, my beloved family who are just if not even more screwed up are leaving me. My sister is taking my nephew away from me. Moving to a new state for financial reasons. He is my absolute world. I\\'ve watched him grow, and think, and create adorable stories that could make anyone laugh. I\\'ve watched him become more and more human each day and I\\'ve had him call me his best friend and call me lego face on halloween when I dressed up as pixels and he means the \\'verse to me. The whole gorram \\'verse. He keeps me still when I want to grab a blade or a bottle of pills and do very stupid things to myself. He keeps me thinking about the benefits of tomorrow instead of the pain.But some days I\\'m so broken he can\\'t fix me. Me. His aunt. I have schizophrenia. And some days I\\'m all too aware of it, and some days, I\\'m gone, some days I can\\'t be bothered to use logic and admit to reality. Some days I spend in my head, talking to other dimensional victims of an interdimentional God that I hear in my head. That I know quite personally at this point. I\\'ve thought about it enough.He won\\'t remember me. He\\'s only 3. He won\\'t remember. I won\\'t be too important in his life if I go now. I don\\'t want to leave him. I want to watch him grow up into a successful little human and earn all his happiness. I want to watch him be the good person I know he will be because his heart is so sweet. But I don\\'t get that. Nope. I don\\'t deserve that. I have other goals. Other missions. Fraking delusions. I don\\'t know that they are.My name is Cristine, I\\'m 22 years old. And I\\'m can communicate with other dimensions. I can hear them, and sometimes see them, and they\\'re begging me for help, they\\'re calling me their savior. \"Your God, he seeks you\" The demon is a God and he is waiting for me on the other side. Waiting to fight for the people he\\'s abusing. I\\'m all too aware I\\'m schizophrenic. But this isn\\'t apart of it. This is real. This has to be real. I have to kill myself to save them. I have to kill myself to go their dimension and kill their demon, their God. He\\'s looking for me. I miss my nephew already. He means so much to me but I have to abandon him for the countless lives I have to save in the other dimension. This isn\\'t easy for me. This is very horribly painful.I only hope he doesn\\'t remember me. I\\'m losing. Whatever the universe is doing to me. I\\'m losing. What\\'s keeping me going now is sitting at home watching scifi shows and reading comics. Trying to keep calm about my own death. I\\'m gonna do it in one month. I\\'m giving myself that much time to get things in order, to have someone convince me the people I HEAR and the people I FEEL suffering are just my brain miscommunications. Oh frak I want to cut. I want to bleed. They told me to, anyways. \"Sacrifice your blood\". I\\'m so far. So lost in the woods. Someone show me a clear path. Did any of that even make sense? I feel so messed up right now. It could just look like nonsense. Please help me. I\\'m only asking here, on reddit, because I trust reddit\\'s help. I\\'ve gotten good help from here in the past. Good people.Help.

I firmly believe in other dimensions. I believe that I can communicate with one. I can hear and rarely see people and creatures from the other dimension. The voices I hear tell me that I have to kill myself in order to travel to the other dimension and kill a mad God that is hurting everyone there. The mad God is also a man from this dimension that abused me as a child and died here and was transported there. I don\\'t know why. But that\\'s what it is. I\\'m on meds. I\\'m well aware that my story above sounds pretty fraked up and crazy. I\\'m aware it sounds delusional and I\\'m aware that I\\'m schizophrenic. But fraking frak. The delusional thinking is so seductive. It grabs hold of me and I can\\'t get it out of my head. I keep thinking that I have to go off my meds, I have to hear voices again, I\\'m their savior. I have to save them. To save them means to end my life. And now I\\'m seriously considering it. Just like I\\'ve done before, except before I determined that it was all a bad idea, that I was simply sick, that the world didn\\'t have that much planned for me. I wasn\\'t really that important. Not the savior of a whole dimension of people suffering and the hands of a pedophile.And now, maybe I am. Maybe it\\'s sick to say. It\\'s just schizophrenia. It\\'s just this disease I have leading me the wrong way in the \\'verse. Or maybe I\\'m really that important. And I need to end my life to save billions. I can get close to him. I\\'m already close to him. I don\\'t know what to do. I want to go off meds, hear voices clearer, listen to what they say and kill myself.. that\\'s my plan. I don\\'t know what to do. I don\\'t belong here I don\\'t belong here I\\'m schizophrenic. I miss the voices. I\\'m all alone now. I have to save them, have to kill myself. I think I\\'m going to do it. I should be getting my refill of Ativan today or tomorrow and with the pills I still have left I think I can leave this dimension and go to the next to save my people. When more of my pills arrive in a couple days I\\'m gonna take them all When more of my pills arrive in a couple days I\\'m gonna take them all I\\'m done. I\\'m absolutely done. No one believes me. No one in real life really gets the struggle. I can\\'t. My therapist says I have \"constant conflicts with reality\" due to my schizophrenia.I can\\'t do this anymore. I have to SAVE a world in another dimension, from a demon. That\\'s as simply as i can put it. That\\'s the gorram truth and no one sees it. They have to open their eyes.When my meds get here I\\'m off. Gonna take a ton of Ativan(I get the 2mg pills instead of 1), with a ton of alcohol and let myself go into the other dimension. It\\'s my responsibility. I just need someone to talk to I just need someone to talk to I need help. Voices. I\\'m schizophrenic. Voices. \"You\\'re crazy\" \"Kill yourself\" \"Your brain is broken\" \"You\\'re a burden\" \"wake up, you\\'re in hell\" \"free me\" \"Kill yourself\" I\\'m better than I was. I admit, I have schizophrenia. There\\'s no doubt anymore. Multiple diagnoses and all. I\\'m sick.\"Can you hear me?\" \"Help us\" I just need to talk. To cry. I need help. It\\'s too much to handle. I\\'m trying to be a person but all I\\'ll ever be is a mentally ill burden on my family. Might as well settle in a board and care now since I\\'ll probably be in one for life. Never see the world. Never love anyone. Just be alone in my head with these voices. I don\\'t have a choice I don\\'t have a choice I\\'m diagnosed with schizophrenia,, and lately it has been unbearable. Every city, every house, every room. The voices never stop. It\\'s my job to listen to them because I\\'m their God. They tell me to kill myself many many time throughout the day, see they need me to die here by suicide so I can go to their dimension and get my God-like abilities back, and defeat a demon that is tormenting them. It\\'s much more intense lately. Urgent. I have to do it *today*. I\\'m going to find a high parking structure and jump off. I have to do it. But I\\'m scared.. but I\\'m still gonna do it. Nothing else matters now, I just have to save them. Everyone is pushing me to kill myself, they want me to, I know they do Everyone is pushing me to kill myself, they want me to, I know they do I live in a Sober Living for my Schizophrenia.. I\\'ve been off meds for over a week now and I\\'m hearing voices. Telling me the truth that the house manager and owner want me to kill myself. They\\'re practically giving me the blade. I know that\\'s what they\\'re thinking, pushing the thoughts on me. Showing their true colors. They\\'re not on my side. I want to cut so bad. I miss it. I *need* it. I talked and talked and talked to the voices for hours yesterday. Just trying to get them to seem fake, but they\\'re not. They\\'re real voices. And I *do* have to kill myself. My family hates me, too. Everyone does. When they\\'re outside smoking they\\'re talking about how much they hate me and want me to kill myself or at least try so I get kicked out of the house, move to my mom\\'s and kill myself from the stress of that. My coworker called me the other day because I seemed \"sad\" at work and he wanted to make sure I was ok. But it wasn\\'t just him. He and a female coworker of mine were talking about me about how I seemed \"sad\". They don\\'t want to make sure I\\'m ok. I\\'m sure my boss has told them about my previous hospitalizations, about how I\\'ve missed so much work due to being in a mental hospital. I\\'m sure they know, waiting for me to break. Fuck fuck fuck. Fucking Fuck I hate them all back and I\\'ll SHOW them. I show \\'em. I have to do it. Everyone NEEDS me to. It\\'s too late to be \"better\". My brain is going to explode. I just want to end it. My brain is going to explode. I just want to end it. Can\\'t talk to my roommates, can\\'t talk to anybody. They get concerned and it scares me to be scaring them. Voices are back. I want to cut. Really deeply. Bleed everywhere and die. I\\'m schizophrenic but I don\\'t know if I can believe that anymore. I\\'m tapping into another dimension.I\\'m fat. I am so fucking fat and ugly. Not fit to be a God. I get medication tomorrow, a shot. Then this all goes away but is it even right?? I hate this. I just want to kill myself. I don\\'t belong I don\\'t belong Nothing here is real, nothing here is right. I’m just walking through the part. Everyday is the same. I work, I function like I\\'m a girl, and I go home and fall apart because I don\\'t have enough distractions.The voices say none of it is real. None of it. That I need to \"wake up\" because maybe I\\'m dreamin\\'. Maybe we all are. And I **created** another dimension as a kid. I made myself the God of it, and it\\'s very real. And I\\'ve never belonged and now it\\'s time for me to kill myself to go there and be a God and save everyone from demons. Things from hell.I think I have to do it this time. I take medication that makes everything blurrier and melts who I am away. I\\'m not a person anymore, I can\\'t stand it. I know the truth and I have to kill myself. I\\'m not a person. This body, this place, means nothing. Yes, I wish I wasn\\'t true. I have people I care for, places I love to go. But they don\\'t mean what you think! None of it means a damn thing.They\\'re all lying about the Schizophrenia, my diagnosis. The medication numbs my ability to hear the voices but I know they\\'re there. Screaming for me to save them.I have to do it, it\\'s so much bigger than me. They\\'re people, *suffering* people. I have to be their God. I have to. I\\'m sorry. I have to do it. Everything is WRONG. I gotta do it. Everything is WRONG. I gotta do it. The voices are gone and it\\'s not ok. It\\'s WRONG. I have to kill myself. I have to save them. Nothing here is real, nothing here is right. It\\'s never gonna be ok. I\\'m meant for something more, and my God is seeking me and it\\'s wrong. It\\'s all fucking wrong. I have to go to HELL, actual HELL in another dimension to save them and I HAVE TO SAVE THEM.I don\\'t know what\\'s right anymore. Is anything? I have to. No one can be trusted. They\\'re reading this now, as I type, watching me with invisibility cloaks. All around me. INTANGIBLE. SURROUNDED.I fucking hate this. I hate it. Sick of medication. Sick of doctor\\'s appointments and therapy and LIES. They know the truth and they are PRETENDING. Making me believe my family is real when the love is a lie. I hate them. He isn\\'t real. He isn\\'t real. The voices are real and I\\'m going to do it SOON. I GOTTA.Maybe today\\'s the day. Just took 30 mg ativan Just took 30 mg ativan Gonna go save the world. Go to another dimension. I have to wake up. I get confused. I remember everything. I remember too much. And I remember nothing. I get confused. I remember everything. I remember too much. And I remember nothing. There\\'s so much empty *space*. it\\'s getting bad again. Not the delusions, not the voices, not the Schizophrenia. Though I hear them screaming every night. I can handle that.I am so distant. So far from ok. I remember him, sitting on his lap, so small. So young. And he would touch me. Every time I saw him, he would. For years and years. And I was just a kid... I just wanted to be a kid.And he took that away from me. From so many. I need to disappear. I can\\'t cope. I can\\'t. He took my childhood, my adolescence. And now he\\'s got me still, at 23. He\\'s got me. He\\'s dead and he has this grip that will never loosen. He\\'s dead and he *got away*.. he\\'s free. I\\'m stuck here, holding the pressure of the *Evil*. There is no justice. No peace. No freedom. And there is no safety. There\\'s so much empty space. Empty space in my memories, what did he *do* to me?!I\\'m so alone. I\\'m alone. I\\'m absolutely fucking alone. I need to just die. I\\'m small and worthless and I can\\'t think straight. I can\\'t do this. I can\\'t be his victim. I can\\'t be left to cope with the nightmare that he created for me. I have to wake up. I get this sort of way, this depressed, miserable way, and I get trapped I get this sort of way, this depressed, miserable way, and I get trapped I just want to end it.. be safe. Be more.The demons are creeping up on me again. Seeing things out the corner of my eye. Whispers and screaming, the kind of screaming that sounds like the person is so terrified. It doesn\\'t go away. Then there are the screams in my heart. The unsteady, rage-filled heart that is an object to a pedophile. Nothing here is real. Is it? I can\\'t tell. I can\\'t know for sure. I love my family. Some of \\'em. It\\'s all I\\'ve got. These people that will never understand me. They\\'re all I\\'ve got.But I doubt that they\\'re real, right? Nothing here is real, nothing here is right. Please forgive me. I\\'m begging. Let go of my death as it doesn\\'t mean what you think.I stand alone in this. The blood dripping down my arms in memories is the only peace I can get, and I can\\'t even do it anymore.I have no savior, I am no savior.',\n",

Even more so because it's about school and home when neither are that bad. Everyone else seems to be able to cope and I just feel like I'm faulty. I find myself crying if I can't do my work, then I make it worse by wanting to give up and not trying.

Tired of the Routine Tired of the Routine I'm in my penultimate year in school. I get up at 7.30/8 each morning, go into school. 15 minutes in registration, 5.5 hours of lessons with an hours break. I come home, dump my stuff in my room and work for most of the evening, or I think about working, feel bad about not actually doing anything. I shower at half past nine and then am usually in bed at ten. I am a night person and I loathe getting up early (yes, 8 is early). I never feel like I've had enough sleep, never want to hang out with friends or do anything really. I never want to eat anything or drink anything. Most days I end up having a headache. I'm getting sick of the music I listen to and cannot find anything new.I'm just getting bored of it all. And I've been feeling like this for a few months now. I'm getting tired of everything. Of the work, of feeling tired all the time, of never wanting to do anything, never wanting to see anyone. Part of me hopes it's temporary, but I can't see anything changing. I need a break from life, it seems, but I won't get one for at least 5 months, but the thought of those five months is heart-breaking. I don't know if I can do it... don't know if I want to.

       " ' Don\\'t know if there\\'s a point in posting but I suppose I\\'ve got nothing to lose. Don\\'t know if there\\'s a point in posting but I suppose I\\'ve got nothing to lose. I tried to kill myself a few months back, basically to avoid being a burden on society because I can\\'t do anything right. I was in the psych ward for a week. I got out. I\\'m supposed to be better now, and for a while I was, with the exception of an apathetic outlook on life.A few weeks ago, our door got stuck shut when my cat was outside. I could have gone out through the garage to get him, but I was tired and not the most logical, so I opened the window that was next to the door and tried to lift the screen out. It wouldn\\'t come out, so I forced it out and bent the frame in the process. Now it\\'s unusable.My mom said she wasn\\'t mad, but told me to be more conscientious next time. She was frustrated though, but seemed quick to forgive me for acting rashly.Today I told her about how our cat couldn\\'t figure out which door to use when I called him in, even though he could see me, sort of as a humorous anecdote I guess because our cat is really dumb. But she started going on about how she was irritated that I was acting thoughtlessly and cost her a screen, and that she didn\\'t know where to get one and how I never have to accept consequences for my actions because I\\'m not a responsible adult. I told her I was really tired and not thinking clearly. She told me, \"Sometimes you have to think clearly.\"She asked me to load the dishwasher and went upstairs. Well of course during this time all I had to think about was what a fuck up I am, and kept imaging vivid images of my arms covered in cuts and bleeding profusely because that\\'s just what I think about when I feel guilty. She came downstairs and asked me if I had any plans today, but I couldn\\'t answer because I was trying not to cry. Then she figured that I was upset, and asked me why. After a long pause I told her that I didn\\'t know she was still upset about the screen.Then she told me about how she had taken years to learn mindfulness, and it just drove her crazy that she had to see all these people go around and make stupid decisions without even thinking. After ranting for a bit, she said she was furious that I went back to my dad\\'s, even after she\\'d given me this opportunity to have a better life. I couldn\\'t tell if she meant the last time I lived with him or a few days ago when I didn\\'t feel well and stayed with him because my appointment was near his house and I didn\\'t feel like driving back (would have been an hour drive), but I didn\\'t ask.Then she went on about how until I learned to do things for myself, I\\'d be a burden, either on her or society. She said it takes a lot of practice to be that mindful and to realize what the right choices are, but that every time I get close I just \"throw it all away\" because I want to be a victim or something. She again referred to me choosing to live with my dad (he\\'s controlling and abusive). She mentioned how I can\\'t stay in school and that I\\'ll probably fail the next time I try because I haven\\'t improved.I don\\'t know if this is her odd way of motivating me. She said I should use these criticisms to realize what\\'s going on and work hard to change. But I\\'ve been in therapy since getting out of the hospital to do just that. I thought I was working on changing.She said she was irritated about the window, but that it wasn\\'t about the window. She asked if I could accept why she was upset. I didn\\'t answer.The whole time it just made sense to me that I\\'m a fuck up and she thought of me as a burden. Everyone probably does. I tried to kill myself before because whenever I tried to change that, whether that be by holding down a job or going to school, I failed or was completely miserable. So I could be miserable not being a burden or make other people miserable by being a burden, which would also make me miserable, or I could just kill myself now and spare everyone and myself all the misery.I don\\'t know why I\\'m writing this, other than to just get my thoughts out there. Or maybe there\\'s another solution and I just haven\\'t thought of it because I\\'m just a thoughtless zombie burden. I\\'m not sure. All I know I that I hate my life and I\\'m no longer attached to its existence.',\n",

They sucked for a long time, in grade 12 I was ready to commit suicide I was ready to end it because I was tired of people telling me I was just seeking attentiona nd that there was nothign wrong with me, that I wasn't stressed that I wasnt unhappy. But some how in no time at all one of my best friends at the time changed that, it was almost like a good bye thing for me to kiss him because I felt like I couldn't do it without letting him know how I felt, but then he kissed me back and he saved me I ddint do it, I ddint want to I wanted to live and be with him. Now a little over 2 years later, I am back to that point. He and I split up back in November, and I ddin't want that I loved him, he made me happy he made me think life was worth living... there were issues I wont deny that but he helped me want to live again. Now I am miserable, Iw as doing ok for awhile but then I started to lose freinds, I am back to being used by my so called friends, my parents are hard on me, I am a college student, I am in debt I had dreams but to my parents they are not ok, they arent realistic and they wotn support me doing them.

Hey /r/SuicideWatch.I found this sub-reddit several days ago and I think this might be the right place to reach out for help.So I\\'m 16 now. My life wasn\\'t really all that bad before. It kinda was, but comparing it to what it is now... back then it wasn\\'t really that bad. I was a straight A student. I almost didn\\'t get a grade different than an A. My mom was a horrible mother back then. She\\'d always yell at me for the littlest of things and beat me with various things. I think that\\'s when I got a bit fucked up in the head. But other than that, I wasn\\'t thinking about everything I\\'m thinking about now... I started getting bad grades at school because I just don\\'t want to study all this bullshit anymore. For me if you want to be like an architect or an engineer, hey that\\'s fine. But I don\\'t wanna study all that stupid stuff I\\'m never going to need or like history and geography just because it\\'s good to know them out of common culture. I hate school. My parents always yell at me because of school. Times like now, winter break are great because I\\'m not at school and they don\\'t get mad about my grades. But maybe it\\'s not just that I don\\'t like school but I\\'m also not motivated to do anything. I used to go to the gym before, now I\\'m just  kinda fluffy, I got a belly. I\\'m going trough a fucking mid-life crysis. I\\'m worried about not getting a job, and how life doesn\\'t seem to make sense... God I don\\'t even know. So many toughts rush trough my head every second I don\\'t even know what to do. I started drinking, smoking. I don\\'t like this shit, I don\\'t think I\\'m cool, but I don\\'t want to live. I don\\'t have the balls to kill myself. I\\'ve thought about it. I\\'ve decided if I\\'m gonna do it I\\'m gonna drown. My mom kicked me out of the house at one Christmas and I was really close to doing it. All I want is to find a girlfriend. I\\'ve never kissed a girl, never had a girlfriend, I\\'m a fucking loser. If I had someone, whom I knew loved me, I think I would want to live. And be a better person for her. But that\\'s never going to fucking happen and it\\'s killing me. I just want to die. The other day I went out with my friend and his gf, and he left early, getting real pissed because he thought I was hitting on his girl. Me and her we continued walking, talking and you know what... yeah I wanted to kiss her. She tried calling him and apologizing and all I could think of was how he was going to leave her, and how I\\'d be there and comfort her and become her new bf. I\\'m a terrible person. I don\\'t even care about friends or moral or whatever. I don\\'t even really have friends. And I don\\'t care if I do.There\\'s a lot more to my story, but I don\\'t really think anyone cares. I don\\'t expect anyone to try and help me, or idk... I just didn\\'t know what to do. I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever find the guts to kill myself. But I do want to die. Also, I created a fake fb of a girl, and I changed my status to in a relationship with her/me. I\\'m going fucking insane. I need help. But I just don\\'t care. Also, english is probably horrible, but it\\'s not my native language. _PERSON_. Put the gun to my head and paint walls with my brains. Put the gun to my head and paint walls with my brains. This might turn out long...I\\'m 16 and 1/2 years old. My name, country and everything else is irrelevant. Let me start from my childhood. My mom beat me up and my dad was a sailor so he would be gone for 6 months at a time. And when he was back, my parents would constantly shout at each other, then my father would go out and get drunk and end up sleeping at my grandma\\'s for a few days.Sure, my childhood sucked, but it\\'s nothing compared to my miserable existence now.I used to have friends. I had good grades... I was somewhat normal. But as life progressed I found out I didn\\'t really have friends. They would get together without me, not invite me to their birthdays. I just gave up on the idea of having friends, thinking they weren\\'t such an important part of life.But the summer 2 years ago, being all alone I spent the entire summer inside, just watching movies all day, going out once a day to get something to eat and that\\'s all I\\'d do. I started feeling lonely. God, I felt lonely... That\\'s when I got in a state of depression. I started hating myself, the way I look, the person I had grow up to become. I realised I\\'m stupid, ugly, fat. I didn\\'t care about any of that before, I used to think I\\'m normal, that I\\'d live a normal life, be a part of the \"System\". Get good grades, get a good job, have a family and finally die. The following year my grades got bad. I started hating school. The teachers, my classmates. I found the material we were learning to be boring and pointless, so I had absolutely no desire to learn it since I thought the educational system was feeding me useless information with a spoon.The next year it got even worse. _PERSON_ even worse. Life even worse. Much lonelier, scared... I wanted to kill myself. I remember the 1st time. I just sat on a bench for 2 hours and thought about how much I want to die. I went to my (GP?) I don\\'t really know what it\\'s called in english, but basically I asked for anti-depresants. She sent me to a psychiatrist in the local madhouse. I spoke to her about the way I felt and since I was underage she said I\\'d have to call my parents. And I did. That\\'s when they found out. The way they explained it was \"To this point they didn\\'t know about my condition. They just thought I\\'m kind of a distant person, not showing much emotion. A part of being a teenager\". But it wasn\\'t like that. What bothered me more is that they found out. I didn\\'t want that to happen because I knew that they\\'d be overly loving and carring for some time and then they\\'d go back to the way they were before as if nothing had happened. Well that\\'s exactly how things went.Anyways I changed 2 doctors, both of them tried to help me, but they couldn\\'t... All they did was perscribe a dozen pills, which didn\\'t do anything but tranquilize me like a horse, not making me feel better, but saditated enough so I don\\'t do anything... kill myself. Which I thought about a lot. Came to the conclusion the best way would be to drown.I had found this subreddit for some time. At New Year\\'s Eve 2013 I read a lot of people\\'s life storries, how miserable their lives where, their expectations that things would get better, but they never did. And since I was alone, my parents gone somewhere I got out in the rain, sat on a bench and stayed there for 2 hours just thinking about my life. That changed me. It made me realise a lot of things. All I ever wanted was to be loved. You\\'d think most guys my age just want to fuck some girl, no emotions no nothing. But I\\'m not like that. Sure, I want to have sex, but what\\'s even stronger in me is the desire to just hug a girl. Hold her thight as time slows down and stops. Being in each other\\'s arms for what seems like an ethernity. Softly kiss. That\\'s all I want. But as old as I am I\\'ve never kissed a girl, had a gf, nothing. I don\\'t wanna become like that guy who killed the people in California. Complaining how he never got laid and what not. I don\\'t want to become psychotic like him. But my life is just falling apart, I have no ambition, perspective. Living day by day, not thinking about the future, because I stoped caring. As if I\\'m already dead and life doesn\\'t matter. I confessed my love to a girl, because I knew at one point she liked me, but I had so many things on my plate I didn\\'t do anything about that. I just let her go. And when I told her I love her she didn\\'t know what to say. And eventually just cut me off, saying her feelings for me were just temporaty and that now I mean nothing to her. She was the best thing that could\\'ve happened in my life and I missed it. At this point, failing school, barely getting out of bed every morning, feeling like crap all the time all I want to do is die. And I\\'ll do it. I just needed to tell someone my story. Even if only one person reads this, I need to know at some point in time another living being knew who I was and my story, so that I don\\'t leave this world as if I had never been in it.I don\\'t think anyone can help me at this point... I really don\\'t. _PERSON_ isn\\'t my 1st language, most of it I haven\\'t learned in school, but by watching cartoon network as a child. So I can speak it well, but punctuation and stuff like that is quite possible to be wrong. Sorry for that.',\n",

       " ' I feel hallow I feel hallow Hi guys,i just want to talk about my life and situation atm. The last couple of years were really wierd for me. Ive had my ups and my downs, like everybody does, but i feel like something isnt going quite right and its pretty obvious. Lets start with my age. What really bothers me is that i forgot how old i am exactly. Either i turn 20 or 21 in the next month and to be honest - i dont even care to look up how old i am. This might not sound to bad, but its more the carelessness that bugs me.. Another thing is that i read all the time or play video games when i dont have to learn for university. I dont go out because i have no friends, so i have learned to spend my time alone with books and videogames. It bothered and worried me in the beginning but not anymore.. I might even be addicted to both. Because im not going out anyway and nobody gets to see me, i dont shower at all. it doesnt make me feel better and i dont even see a point in it, because theres nobody around me anyway. My appartment is pretty much a mess, but ive managed to controll it so its not all that horrible. One problem is the kitchen tho. Everything in my fridge is rotten, it smells like i have a dead body in it.. Even tho i thought i need to clean it because its obviously not healthy (i dont even put food in my fridge tho), i am never doing it and to be frank it doesnt even seem to matter to me.Another thing that concerns me is my sexuality. While im having some fetish, i wouldnt say im to far away from the norm. I never had a girlfriend even tho i would consider myself good looking (and in school atleast i was good smelling too :p), but i never really cared about it. Having a girlfriend or a family just seems wrong to me. Another thing is that i am born with phimosis and i never even seen a doctor because of it. It just feels senseless to me to \"fix\" the situation, because i cant see myself with a woman anyway.Other than that.. sometimes im sad because i grew up without a father and when i actually think about him it makes me sick and i wish for him to \"disappear\". He contributes to the hate and sadness i have inside. (i dont want to talk about him further)I just feel empty. I want someone who understands me, who laughs with me. What i want is to find happiness and prove myself that i am not as worthless as i might be in reality.I dont really have something im very good at. Im mediocre at writing and playing games. Well, i guess i know what i learned during my studies, but im far from the best in my course(s). I know someone who was a friend of mine before i went away to study, he has passion for sports, wants to keep in shape and is now going to the police.Thats what i want... a goal to persue, but i cant find something i show passion for. Its almost like im just mindlessly consuming food and drinks, reading about wonderful stories, lifes and possiblities, while in real life just waiting to die. Every night, i listen to the sound of my heart beating and trying to make sense of my existence, even tho its more than foolish. Theres no reason, but i thought i might as well try to spend my time on earth happy, or atleast building up or destroying something. If i die this second nowbody but my mother would be bothered or really be sad about it.. Hell i dont even think my father would be at my funeral. Thats atleast what my mother told me.I just feel empty and i want so much to fill it. All i know is i need to find something i can dedicate my life to before my mother dies. I cannot die, before she does, it would make her sad and break her heart. And i just cant and dont want me to picture her sad, because i care about her more than all other people in my life combined. If she would be gone there wouldnt really be anything else i could hold on to. Of course i thought of just letting go, but i came to the conclusion that is not what i want.I want people to recognise me, curse me, love me,fear me and know my name. I want to help the world to change and leave my imprint before i go. I just dont know how yet.  So i dont see myself dying soon even tho it would make things a lot easier. I dont know what to do.. (besides that i have to clean my goddamn fridge): wait until i just find something im passionate for?Pray for the best? (even tho i dont believe in any god)Im not sure what i want to hear from you guys, i guess i just wanted to write it down and tbh it helped. It could be worse :pPS: Sorry for my bad english.

       " ' Feeling extremely depressed lately. Self-worth is pretty low. Feeling extremely depressed lately. Self-worth is pretty low. I\\'m in college right now, student-athlete, male, age 22. Lately, I\\'ve been having almost flashbacks of my school days where I was bullied. In my K-12 years, I was bullied constantly. I suffer from Aspergers syndrome and placed in RSP (program for students with disabilities). Other students knew this and gave me hell for it. I was called things like \"retard\", \"stupid\", \"special ed\", etc. I was physically assualted quite a bit during elementary school and middle school (I had my first suicidal thoughts at the age of 8). During high school it was more verbal, however I did have objects thrown at me. I was even called a retard by my 4th grade teacher for failing a drawing assignment. I was great at history but sucked at mathematics. I used to envy and loathe honor students. Many of the honor students also happened to be the popular kids as well. I was also told things like \"I would never pass middle school\". These events are over, however for some reason they have been tormenting me  recently. My self-worth is low and I\\'m viewing myself as a \"retard\" again like I did in my K-12 years. Secondly, for some reason I will have a crush on a girl. Then the crush turns into an obsession, then most of my time will be dedicated to thinking about her. These usually happen with girls that I know I can\\'t have. And usually they have certain physical characteristics that I eventually obsess over as well. I usually find black and mixed race (black and something else) women the most attractive. Before that I used to be fixated on redheads, so on and so forth. Recently, I have been fixated on this mixed race girl that i have only met once 6 months ago. Don\\'t even really know her. However, I have been thinking heavily about her recently. She goes to a christian college 400 miles away (I should probably note that I\\'m agnostic). We had a small talk and she gave me seemingly flirtatious smiles and giggles. Because of this I have been thinking about her heavily know, been totally fixated on her. I recently added her on facebook, but the friend request is still pending (it\\'s been 3 days). Last time this happened it was with another mixed race girl and a black girl before that. It is driving me crazy, and ultimately extremely depressed. I also feel horrible that I\\'m fixating so much on a womens race, it feels so wrong, but for some reason I find black and mixed race girls extremely attractive. And I feel being fixated on specific girls and a specific race ruins opportunites with potentially awesome women. I feel lost. Lastly, I have been feeling isolated with almost everybody I know. I feel like I can\\'t relate to anybody anymore. I feel like I can\\'t express my feelings with people I know. I have been going to church to find a sense of community, but it\\'s not really helping. I feel alone and isolated. I excersise a lot for my training for my sport. I spend about 2-5 hours each day working out. I lift 3 days a week and do cardio 5-6 days a week(I ran 5 miles yesterday). That provides me with temporary relief. But after that, I feel empty again. I get like this sometimes, but recently has been extremely bad. I don\\'t know if I\\'m exactly suicidal, but I\\'m afraid of going down that road again. I feel out of whack Reddit, any advice would be greatly appreciated.',\n",

I just googled suicide watch in google and came here since I spend so much time on reddit anyways. Sorry if I was pathetic, or if my english was bad, I don't use either very often, but I really needed a place where I could tell someone how I feel.

Prior to about 2 weeks ago, I had never had a suicidal though. It came out of nowhere, and I can\\'t figure out why it\\'s happening. I\\'m 23Long story short, I graduated back in college with an engineering degree, and went straight into a corporate job. At first, I was really happy. College was very stressful for me, and corporate life is comparatively much easier. That said, my job isn\\'t stimulating at all. A lot of times, I sit at my desk for 8 hours reading reddit and watching youtube. I can only work from home when I\\'m sick or can\\'t otherwise make it to the office. I almost never have enough work to fill 40 hours a week. I look forward to leaving at the end of the day and coming home to my roommates. For my age group, I make excellent moneyHowever, the last two weeks or so, I haven\\'t found any joy outside of work either. My routine is getting stale, and I\\'m not finding anything that can replace that routine, and I\\'m sorta stuck in a rut. I used to love video games. Now I don\\'t, and I\\'m finding myself doing more or less nothing for hours after I come home. I might read for an hour, watch netflix for an hour, etc. Then I go to bed, wake up the next morning, and do it all over again. Then comes the weekend. Friday night/saturday morning are about the only time I\\'m reasonably happy. I might go out with a friend, see a movie, sleep in a bit. By about noon, I\\'m bored again, and the rest of the weekend is a slog.Now, part of it is that last summer I was rock climbing a ton, which I find very rewarding. Unfortunately, it hasn\\'t been warm enough to climb recently. I\\'m seriously hoping I\\'m just going stir crazy. But then I start thinking about it, and I\\'m like \"I don\\'t even feel like going right now\".So yeah, I\\'m starting to get the feeling that the things in my life that I used to find meaningful aren\\'t meaningful anymore, and it scares the crap out of me. If I can\\'t find meaning in my life, why live? At first, that thought was fleeting, but today while I was bored to death at work, that thought started to consume me. And it hasn\\'t really left since. What the heck is the point of living if none of it is meaningful? If I\\'m just going to have 80 more years of nothing meaningful, then I have no desire to keep living. To put it succinctly, if every week is like the past couple weeks have been, I don\\'t want to live. Objectively, the past two weeks haven\\'t even been bad. And that scares the shit out of me.Please don\\'t say \"wow must be nice to have your life\". I absolutely agree with you. I have a great family, relatively good job, a nice car, an apartment with roommates, and all I can think about is how bored I am all the time. And for whatever reason, my scumbag brain can\\'t get rid of the idea that \"suicide will fix it!\". I\\'m just not finding joy in anything over the past few weeks. Not the gym, not rock climbing, not hockey, especially not work, not video games, you get the idea. Please help me.

       " ' Here\\'s my post about what I threw away Here\\'s my post about what I threw away I\\'d just like to get all this down somewhere and hopefully organize my thoughts along the way. Hello, by the way. In advance, thanks for reading. I\\'m 25 now. Male. I\\'ll preface this by saying that I\\'ve had a lot of mental issues ever since I can remember, but I won\\'t get too much into that just for the sake of time. I have depression, ocd, social anxiety, trichotillomania, I might be bipolar? and I might also be a compulsive liar. I don\\'t know. After I graduated from college with a _PERSON_\\'s degree in Culinary Arts / Nutrition I was almost immediately hired into a culinary management training program for a large, successful hotel company. As I lived in New York at the time at my family home, I had to move out to one of their properties in California if I wanted to take the job. Of course I leapt at the offer! Fast forward a little bit, I\\'ve moved out there to CA, started my job and had my own apartment, am paying my bills/college loans. I leased a new car. I made enough money that I could throw it around a little, within reason. But I was overall pretty comfortable. I lived about 1 mile from a popular beach in a community with a good night life, selection of restaurants/shops and easy access to the highway. After a year of living there I get pretty tired of my job. The hours are long, I work 60+ hours a week and sometimes work up to 10 days at a pace with no break in-between. I\\'ve worked in the culinary industry before and am no stranger to this, but I\\'m just not that passionate about the field anymore and want to do something else. Something less stressful with less hours, more of a stable lifestyle. I don\\'t have the aspirations to be a great, famous chef.But the problem was that they really liked me at the company. When I was there I worked hard, was passionate about the food that I made and my chefs and co-workers noticed this. Towards the end of my time there, the chefs wanted to make me a sous-chef (pretty big deal for someone like me right out of school). And here I am, who doesn\\'t want it. Other people would jump at the opportunity, would give so much just to have ANY job.I lived in California and worked at the hotel for nearly 2 years before I made the decision to move back home to New York. I wanted to move back home to NY to be closer to my friends/family. I wanted to explore a new job and hopefully make a career change. I wanted to live in New England.Toward the end of my time in Cali I was thinking about killing myself nearly everyday, and in fact one day I wrote a letter to my family and came very close to acting on it. I have had serious thoughts on suicide for many years now, but they wax and wane. When I was in my adolescence I was put in the hospital for an otc drug overdose, a botched suicide attempt. Well, I ended up quitting and moving home last October. I packed all my crap up and drove back to NY and moved back in with my parents in their apartment. Since then I\\'ve been looking for a job, trying to figure out what the fuck I want to do with my life and just can\\'t seem to think of anything that I\\'m really that interested in doing. I\\'m at my wits end and I just don\\'t want to try anymore. I owe a lot of student loans for a degree that I\\'m not all that interested in. The urge to commit suicide has been so strong. I know now that I won\\'t do anything beneficial to the rest of the world. I\\'m just a leech. I don\\'t go outside anymore, I just sit in my room with the shades drawn and browse the internet for jobs or bullshit &amp; play games. Generally, I don\\'t go outside for days at a time. The friends that I thought I had here in NY aren\\'t really there for me. I\\'ve been having issues with my fiance too, but that could be a whole other post in itself. She\\'s been fucking this other guy and spending a lot of time with him. We\\'re in an \"open\" relationship, but so far it\\'s just been her spending time with other guys and me spending time with ... myself.I really, really, really should have stayed where I was. I had it so good there, and I threw it all the fuck away... and for what?I\\'m not sure if I can continue writing this, there\\'s a lot of thoughts in my head screaming for attention and I can\\'t seem to write them down in an orderly manner anymore. I apologize if this didn\\'t make sense to you, but it makes me feel a little better that I can share this with someone. Exhausted Exhausted Before I get into things, I just wanted to preemptively thank you for sharing your time with me. I\\'m sorry we couldn\\'t meet under better circumstances.It\\'s hard to know where to begin. I\\'ve had a long and ugly history with suicide and self harm. It first became apparent in my teens, and came to a head when I landed myself in an overnight hospital stay for attempting to OD on prescription pills. Since that particular occasion about 10 years ago, I haven\\'t had another \"serious\" attempt, although the suicidal thoughts have been ever present and plans have been thought through. A couple weeks ago I again tried to kill myself. Only my best friend knows about this attempt. Without getting into details, the method was carbon monoxide. It  would have been so perfect if that attempt were to have worked. I was ready. I drove about 8 hours from home to the place where I had thought to attempt the deed. My parents thought I was going to a job interview a few states away and wouldn\\'t be home for a few days. I wrote out my notes to my loved ones, I spent the entire day in reflection in a naturally beautiful and peaceful place that I\\'ve loved since I was a boy, and by the end of the day when I started my preparations I was calm and at ease. Ready for the next step, ready to finally rest. Suffice it to say, here I am, still talking to you now. I\\'ve felt for a long time that I will eventually end my own life someday. It could be this year, the next, or perhaps 10-20 years down the road. Matters in my life have been taking a tailspin for years, and it\\'s only a matter of time until I well up the courage again to make another determined action. Perhaps the worst part about it is that many people have a worse life than I do. I take so much for granted. A family that loves and supports me both mentally and economically while I\\'m unemployed. I\\'m in good physical health. I have a close friend who listens to me \\xad\\xadconstantly talk about my retinue of problems, and has never once complained. I was fortunate enough to go to college, and I have nice things like a computer and a smart phone. So many things I have that others do not, and it makes me feel so goddamn guilty for not appreciating them. I know what I *should* do. I should dust myself off and try my best to pick up the scattered pieces of my life. If not for myself, then for my parents whom have given so much up for my sibling and I over the years. But I find myself totally inable. Some days I actually do try to engage in positive activities to break free from this horrible vicious cycle, however it seems that they always seem to blow up in my face. I\\'ve all but given up trying to find a job- it\\'s been nearly two years since I\\'ve been gainfully employed. My GF of about a year left. The majority of my friends have all moved away or just don\\'t have time for me anymore, neither of which is their fault. I have insomnia and can\\'t sleep more than 4 hours or so at a clip, yet I still stay in bed most of the day and read or netflix; anything to escape from the reality of my situation. You know, I do wish that things would get better. I want a job, I want friends to go out and have fun with, I want a romantic relationship that finally works. I want to move away from my parents house again. I just don\\'t see it happening. None of that is in the cards for me. And yeah, I know you can only make it happen for yourself and none of that will be handed to you on a silver platter unless you work for it, but from the direction things are going in, I just don\\'t think I can muster up the strength to try anymore. I\\'m so, so tired. Just so tired Just so tired Hey. I just need to get my thoughts down (again), and I\\'m sorry if the prose is slightly scatter-brained. I apologize if you\\'re sick of hearing from me by now; I couldn\\'t blame you. There are plenty of other lost souls on this subreddit who deserve the attention much more.I think I\\'m going to attempt to kill myself within the next few days. I\\'ll be using the same method I tried about a month ago- carbon monoxide -and hopefully it will be more successful this time. I\\'m just not sure of where exactly I\\'m going to do it, and a few other logistics. I drove 8 hours through a handful of states for the last attempt (and another 8 hours back home directly after the failed attempt), and I just don\\'t have another long drive in me, especially if I fail again.No one knows about the last attempt but for my best friend, whom I had confessed to after the fact, and you guys. I\\'ve wrestled with many mental issues throughout more than half my life, and I\\'m just so done. Before you ask- I\\'m not seeing a therapist, I\\'m not professionally diagnosed by a doctor or taking any medications to deal with my problems. I exercise every couple days, which is about all I do to try to better myself. I know those are all paths I need to follow, or face the consequences and die prematurely. Some compassionate redditors reading this subreddit have suggested those things and more to me in the past. But I just cannot bring myself to do it. I just want the pain to stop, I want my horrible thoughts finally quelled, I want to say my goodbyes to the world that I know and just *sleep*. I know this inaction to try to fix my problems makes me undeserving of the life I have, especially when considering how many utterly innocent people there are out there in the world who endure untold suffering due to war, unchecked disease, extreme poverty and famine. Many of these people will die young and never get even a glimpse at the life that I\\'m afforded with modern luxuries such as a secure house with electricity and plumbing, medicine and an organized government. It\\'s all relative though. But despite all that.. I just can\\'t do it anymore- deep in my heart I\\'ve given up. The spark of life is gone.Thank you for these few moments of your time. Well, here I am once more. Well, here I am once more. Hello. It turns out I\\'m a serial poster here. My girlfriend of about a year and I broke up last April. I\\'ve been pretty fucked up since then. The day after we broke up I blew off a job interview I had that day and tried to kill myself with carbon monoxide (not simply a suicide \"gesture\", explained more completely in an older post here). She doesn\\'t know about it. It wasn\\'t just because of our breakup- I have a lot of other things going on in my life which contribute toward the feelings. Since that failed attempt I\\'ve had my highs and lows, although my highs were not particularly high and my lows have reached greater and greater depths as time drags on. I think of suicide c-o-n-s-t-a-n-t-l-y.We hadn\\'t texted or chatted on Facebook since June 12th, which is a long time for me. I foolishly broke the law of No Contact tonight by trying to call her up. She didn\\'t answer, as usual, nor did I receive any text. I will probably get one tomorrow morning when she\\'s on her way to work. It will wake me up and I won\\'t be able to fall back asleep again. She\\'ll say she\\'s sorry she couldn\\'t pick up because she was out with friends, or she had an early night. Things she usually says when she doesn\\'t answer. Perhaps she was fucking a new boyfriend. Who knows.I don\\'t know what I expected or wanted- I suppose simply to hear her voice again. I haven\\'t heard her voice since January. When she left it was as if my arm was cut off, she was a part of me. The best part of me. Now that we arent talking anymore I\\'ve lost my best friend, my lover. My will to move on and to find a job and to move out of my parents house and better myself is all dried up. I don\\'t think I will linger much longer. Tomorrow Night Tomorrow Night Tomorrow night I\\'m going to do it. I\\'m going to leave in a few hours and drive into the night from my home to the same spot where I tried to kill myself last April. It\\'s far, but what does that matter anymore? I\\'m packing whatever shit I need, I\\'m going to wipe my computer, clean my room and not look back. I can\\'t wimp out this time. If it doesn\\'t work this time I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do with myself. I need to stop being a wimp and use a more deadly method this time. I can\\'t keep going on like this.',\n",
       " \" I'm feeling suicidal after a sudden realisation and pressure. I'm feeling suicidal after a sudden realisation and pressure. I am feeling quite depressed and suicidal, despite the fact that I never usually feel like this. I had a breakdown earlier this week, bursting into tears because my friend has been taken away from me and I can't talk to him in public. All my school work in getting on top of me and stressing me out. To make things worse, someone who was bullying me got stabbed after I stood up for him, now I feel guilty. I also have to report one of my friend's for child pornography. With all this going on, I'm just becoming so stressed and upset and thinking that life is actually pointless. What am I to do? I honestly don't know where to go anymore. I honestly don't know where to go anymore. I've never been a big lover of life, I think too much to enjoy the little things. However, I've always trudged through life with the hope of being successful and having enough material things to make up for happiness. Suddenly, life hit me and I gained friends who I cared about and I started to feel a little better about myself and my Autism.Now, I just feel empty again. Most of my friends are leaving me or they've fallen out with me. My family's financial situation is horrible, I'm being kicked out of my home by my own grandmother and we are in debt. My mother is depressed and we don't get on. Everyone is arguing, I hate how life is for us. My father pays no attention to me, he's off having an affair on his current wife who is horrible to me.I get bullied and I only trust two people, I fucked it up pretty bad with one of them by confessing my feelings for him. I've made his life pretty shit over the past few years, he would have a much better life without me here. Everyone would. I make everyone's life worse, I'm a huge burden.I wish life was simple again, where I only cared about myself and my possessions. Why did I have to love? I just want to sink into the floor. I don't know what is real anymore and it's hard. I need help, please. I need help, please. I'm really not coping well, being so socially troubled and autistic. I can't deal with extreme emotion. This love, this pain, it's killing me. He knows of my feelings and my fear of rejection, yet he tells me he hates me, I'm too clingy and that he only became friends with me because he pitied me.He is avoiding me and saying hurtful things to me. It's probably my fault, I deserve it. I am too possessive.He sits and laughs with his friends about the situation, but says he's depressed and that he's sick of feeling guilty. A year ago, I hit his friends, I had anger issues. Now, I'm coping with it and I haven't been violent for ages.I feel tired and sick all the time, even when I do sleep. I can't concentrate on my studies and I'm regressing. He said that I'll end up hurting myself and today, I did. I smacked my head against a table. It made my headache worse. My mum doesn't know, but everyone at school does.Today, I left my classroom for air and I heard everyone calling me a retard and laughing, even the teacher didn't say anything.I can't do it anymore. I feel so miserable and depressed. I want to die.\",\n",
       " \" I need to vent I need to vent I am a high school student in my junior year. But unlike many people I know who trudged through high school carrying the familiar blanket of depression, I probably have the male high school dream life on the outside. I'm in the top of the rugby squad, handsome (so I'm told), and popular. With the massive circle of friends that appears to orbit my every move, it's a wonder how I feel so downtrodden and lonely. But no matter how populated my surroundings are, I can never be rid of the loneliness in my heart.The most frustrating aspect of this problem is its inability to be explained to others. No one seems to get it. No one thinks the popular guy can be sad.The only actions I can take that momentarily distract me are running or working out. For a moment I forget the pain, and then it just seeps back in.I've tried to seek counseling with three different people who were recommended by family. Each one told me the same thing. You need God boy! I suppose that is the consequence of being an Atheist in the bible belt. To a hammer every problem looks like a nail I suppose. I know religion brings joy and comfort to many people but for certain reasons I know I will never want to welcome religion back into my life ever again.I can't shake this shadow that seems to follow me around. Sometimes I want to just give up and melt into a corner. The only thing that stops me is knowing that I'm depended upon by so many others.The worst thing is the future. I don't want it. I don't want to know what happens when my life raft of familiar friends is stripped away. I'm scared it won't get better. But it has to at some point right?\",\n",

I'm under a huge amount of stress and I just can't cope with it. When I started college in Fall 2012 I wanted to change from the socially awkward, skinny, acne covered person I was in high school. So I looked at the major things I wanted to achieve and worked my ass off to get them. I now have a 3.9 GPA in an engineering degree, a high paying internship at a fortune 500 company, gained 30 lbs lifting weights and through heavy doses of Accutane last year, got rid of my acne. I tried very hard to become more social, gained some friends and have had a couple girlfriends in the last 2.5 years. Yet, all of these great things have piled up so high and now consume such a huge amount of time that I just feel completely buried under it all. I never have a moment to sit down and take a breath. I've worked so hard to get to where I am, but I'm just miserable. From the outside looking in I'm doing fantastic, but from the inside looking out, I've never felt worse. I don't want to give up anything I've achieved and don't know what to do at this point. Can someone give me some serious advice on how I should handle this?\",\n",

       " \" Planning to do it tomorrow Planning to do it tomorrow I can't do this any more. I don't even know why if I'm being entirely honest - I just got out of hospital for depression a week ago, and I'm already suicidal again. Got out feeling on top of the world, and now I'm back down at the bottom. Normally going into hospital gets me a few months of happiness before I end up back in there, but now? Now I can't even get a full week. What the hell is the point any more? My anxiety is so intense that I can't even make it out the door for anything more than a walk each day, and I can barely do that because I'm too out of shape to do anything more than 2km. The anxiety is also stopping me from even attending outpatients at the hospital, so fuck that avenue too. I can't even get support from professionals because I'm too damn nervous to get out the door and catch a train down there.I'm just sick of it. Sick of feeling like a no-hoper who's gonna be stuck living off welfare for the rest of his life because of the anxiety (it's considered bad enough that I'm on a disability pension) sick of not being able to study because I have fuck all concentration, sick of not being able to get a girlfriend, or even new friends, because I can't leave the house. I'm just... Sick of life.The only thing that's making me hesitate is the fact that my mother suffers from depression as well, and I worry that I may tip her over the edge if I do anything, same goes for my best friend. But... that motivation to keep living is getting thinner and thinner. I don't even know if I want to be persuaded, but I figure that for their sake, I should try Have access to an assload of meds, trying very hard to resist overdosing... Have access to an assload of meds, trying very hard to resist overdosing... Ugh, I'm posting here because I don't know who else to turn to. I have friends who know about my depression and are supportive, as well as family, but if I tell them how close I am to taking all those pills, chances are I'll be back in hospital within a week and I'll have the pills taken away from me and hidden. That's the last thing I want to happen right now, because I feel like the only actual option I have in my life right now is that of suicide - I don't want that one option to be taken away from me. Even if I choose not to commit suicide, I at least want to be ABLE to do it, if I should change my mind later. So I really don't want to tell my friends or family any of this.Thing is though, my parents are gone at the moment, so I'm alone in the house and my pills are accessible to me for the first time in about a year - normally my mum just hands out my daily doses and that's all I get. The fact that I can finally actually overdose like I've been considering for so long... it's so hard for me to resist right now.I'm scared, and I don't know what to do. It's not the thought of death that scares me, it's the thought that if I act on these thoughts, it'd tear my family apart, and I don't want to be responsible for that.But on the other hand, I'm so sick of being so anxious all the goddamn time, always being alone. Please help, somebody. I don't even know what I want, but... please help. So I've finally finished planning - going to do it in February, so I have plenty of time to change my mind. So I've finally finished planning - going to do it in February, so I have plenty of time to change my mind. I hesitate to even write this post, because it reeks of attention-seeking to write a suicide post 2 months before I'm even planning to do it, but I guess I want to be talked out of it, for the sake of my family.I've finally figured out my method, I've figured out what I'm writing in my note, how and when in the day I'm going to do it to minimize chances of being discovered. Basically, I'm just sick to death (hah) of all the anxiety and depression, of being in and out of hospital. I feel like a waste of space on this planet, not contributing anything to society, just taking a disability pension every fortnight because of severe anxiety that stops me functioning properly and being able to live a halfway decent life.I don't WANT to commit suicide, mainly because of my family, who I know will be devastated by it (especially because my mum already suffers from depression herself) but frankly, I'm just... sick of it. I figure I'll wait until February, mainly so I can last through Christmas. My mother LOVES Christmas, so I don't want to forever have that time of year affiliated with my death for her, and I'm planning to see my dad in another state one last time before I go, so that rules out the first half of January. Then I'm going back into hospital in the first half of Feb for an anxiety and depression program which, quite frankly, I can't see working. But I'll give it one last shot, and if it doesn't work, I guess I'll end it once and for all. Just wanted to get that off my chest. I've been wanting to tell somebody for a couple of weeks now, but anybody I know in real life would just try to put me in hospital again, which I really don't want.

I\\'m not rich, nor tall nor handsome. I don\\'t have charisma, women are repelled by me. Frankly I don\\'t care how family would react anymore. If that makes me selfish, or an asshole, or scum I dont know what to say. Actually thats been my reaction to everything lately. I don\\'t want to die really, but I don\\'t want to bother living either. I mean seriously what is the point? My grades suck, I can\\'t make decent money, I\\'m a bitter social retard.  If by some miracle I did make friends and get a girlfriend, well that just brings even more problems. The only problem is I dont have a gun handy. I already feel dead, why not? I already feel dead, why not? Here I am, going back to the city. Going back to my mom, who will no doubt tell me I need to find a job and go to college. Who thinks that because I am suddenly on a campus or at a job, I will be happier. That girls will come with the job, that things will work out in five years. I cant wait around for five fucking years.The revelation was when I was at the bar the other day. Other people have no problem with social contact, making friends, chasing girls, dating, etc I just felt awkward and out of place. I dont have confidence, I dont have social proof. I was standing at the bar and two girls seemed to laugh at me.I dont know people, I dont have any skills except computers. I dont even have an interest in that field anymore. Frankly I get annoyed when family asks why Im so sad, they say things are wonderful. Things are not wonderful.Meanwhile I read stories \"Im dating her\", \"I almost got arrested there\" \"I went to Vegas with my friends\". Im having doubts SW. Doubts this will ever change. Ive always been shy, what chance in hell do I have of being the charismatic guy people love?

       " ' 28, have never had a life, I want it to be over so bad. When is it enough? 28, have never had a life, I want it to be over so bad. When is it enough? Hi guys, I’m just going to lay it out since my writing goes to hell when I’m in this sort of state. I’m 28, I have suicidal depression, social anxiety, general anxiety, self harm, I’m 100lb overweight (down from 200lb), horribly abusive family and last but worst, OCD (tactile hypersensitivity, to make a long story short, the inability to tolerate feelings like the seams in clothing has gutted my life).Because of the above reasons, high school almost killed me. Shortly after graduating and after a particularly bad family fight I got on a train and moved cross country to the west coast, hoping that distance and a big new city would give me the chance I needed to live a real life. 3 months later I found that separation anxiety from the abusive family was crippling me with panic attacks and I moved home. I really can’t explain it other than, we’ve all seen the cops tv shows where the woman is battered and bloody and refuses to press charges on the guy that did it because maybe if she does just the right thing, maybe then he’ll love her? Its like that I guess. So I came home. I had enough sense in me to know I couldn’t come back to my family’s house so I moved in with extended family who was close. They treated me mostly the same and after 4 years of that (long time I know, but punishment is what I know) I took off again to the east coast with the same hopes of a real life. Falling apart this time at 4 months and coming home, this time to the original family house. I’ve been back for 2 years now, and its worse than ever. I spend 22 hours a day in a room in the basement crying from panic attacks and cutting myself to shreds. The other 2 hours I face the family which gives me enough punishment to do another 22 hours here.I don’t ever see it getting better for me. I’ve run to both ends of the country and failed both times. If I make it long enough, I’ll run again, but I know how that ends. I just got a disability letter partially approving me, but I don’t even care because even if I could get the money to move myself away, it would just be another room to sit and die in…until the anxiety drove me home again.  The only thing I even really want in life, honestly, was a relationship, someone to love and be loved by. Having never really felt it before, I have it so built up in my head that it must be wonderful. But being 100lb overweight, having no career and no money, and social anxiety that leaves me shaking and sick if I even try to say Hi to someone, I don’t think I’ll ever have that. And if I can’t have it, there’s no real consolation prize that is worth staying around for. I’ve wanted to die since I was 14, I’m utterly ashamed that I’ve spent 14 more years wanting it and not doing it while making almost no forward progress on fixing myself. And I have tried to fix myself. I’ve been in therapy for 7 years. Been on 2 dozen anti depressants. Tried every support group I’ve been able to. I’ve got a self help library that will thrill the local library when they inherit it. I had bariatric surgery and lost 70 of the 100 pounds I mentioned before. Nothing has ever removed the lump in my throat, every morning that I’ve woken up for 14 years has hurt to realize I’m alive for another day. For the first time in my life I got a reprieve 3 months ago. Its crazy but bear with me. After reading a study from johns Hopkins on magic mushrooms treating depression I tried it myself and got similar results. Within 2 days I felt what I imagine normal happy people must feel like all the time. I wasn’t sad, I was just ok, and after having been sad most of my life, being ok was the best feeling I’ve ever felt. I still had all of the real problems I listed but I felt like the sky was the limit, I was going to work my ass off and fix these things and surely within 2 or 3 years I was going to have that life I spent so much time fantasizing about. I bought a bike and put 1000 miles on it in 2 months and lost 30 more lb. For 2 months I didn’t cry once or use a single ativan for a panic attack. It physically felt like there was a burden lifted from me, being alive didn’t feel like walking through mud anymore. But optimism alone doesn’t save you when everything around you wants to tear you down. Christmas kicked my ass, my family had no tolerance for this new up beat person and worked double time to hurt him. It worked, I lost the grip I had on my new happiness. At 3 months, I tried the mushroom thing again and it has not worked as well as before, maybe a little, but then I’m still writing this letter tonight after all. Its left me heartbroken, to have seen the light and had it pried out of my hands. And what is there left to try to get it back? Which by the way is my most important question here, what do I have left to try? I’m 28 with nothing, even if I had that happiness back and it stayed, I would be 30 something before I ever had a life. And I don’t see how someone can make a real life at that point, it would be more of a patchwork _PERSON_ in the shape of a real life. Anyway, I’ve droned on too long anyway, sorry for beating you with a wall of text if you’ve made it this far, I can add to it in replies if needed. I just need to know, at what point do we cash in our chips and figure its not going to get better so lets just stop the suffering? How does someone in my position, this late in life, salvage anything worthwhile out of it?TL:DR  I’m 28 and have never had a life, too broken to make one and treatment is not healing me. At what point is it too late? What happens after suicide with or without a will? What happens after suicide with or without a will? I don\\'t want to ask in /r/asklegal because they\\'ll get hung up on the wrong part of the question. If I thought there was something that could be said to prevent the suicide in the first place, Id be asking that instead. I don\\'t have much to leave behind. I would like to leave one friend my camera and hard drive full of my work, then my laptop to another friend. But neither lives close enough to get it themselves, it would have to be mailed. And then finally I wanted to be cremated and have my ashes sent to the first friend (they\\'ve agreed). The problem is my family won\\'t be cooperative with any of it, they won\\'t want to give up items they could keep themselves and they certainly won\\'t respect the cremation or giving the ashes away. How do you enforce any of it? It seems like once the police take the body away the apartment will just be left alone and the next people to come in will be my family, who can then just tear up a will and throw it away, or take the items and say they never saw them. Same goes with the ashes, the coroner will ask the family what they want done and they\\'ll tell him their wishes, not mine.Does anyone know how this would work out? I guess I could take care of part of it by mailing the items myself before hand, but I feel like when I finally get the nerve, the time between deciding to do it and doing it will be too quick to get side tracked with mailing stuff tomorrow. Also it would probably be too painful to send it all away myself. Does anyone get better after wanting to die for so long? Does anyone get better after wanting to die for so long? I\\'m 28 now, the depression became suicidal at 14, life wasn\\'t very good before that and I don\\'t remember much before 10. I\\'ve wanted to die for almost all of my memorable life. I work so hard at getting better, but it\\'s not really \"getting better\" because I was never ok to begin with, I don\\'t even know what it\\'s like to feel like a normal person. To think that now, in what would be the middle of a normal life, I\\'m going to pull it all together and be able to do all of the things I\\'ve never been able to do? How realistic is that?Besides the depression I deal with OCD, social anxiety, normal anxiety and a horrible family. Since I was little it left me too scared of people to have friends and too tormented by the OCD to do much but stay home and hide, and that family and the anxiety to tear me apart while I did that. College was out of the question for the same reasons, but eventually I felt that if I could just get away from the damage the family was doing, I could be happy. I tried twice, at 20 and 24 I moved to either end of the country. I fell apart both times within 3 months, I don\\'t know why, a lot of anxiety I suppose and at this point I\\'m a codependent on that messed up family. I moved out for a 3rd time and I\\'m 3 month into it now. I don\\'t want to go home but it\\'s made me realize something worse. I finally got out and separated myself from them and nothing is any better. I live off of a little savings that will eventually run out. I worry constantly about the money, it\\'s not the ocd that keeps me in anymore but the cost of going out and the anxiety of it all anyway. I can\\'t find a job, I\\'m not cut out for anything but washing dishes and even that causes a breakdown after a few weeks because of the ocd. I\\'m too depressed to work on my own business, that takes so much from even a normal person, I was crazy to think I could do it. And most importantly, I still can\\'t have a relationship or even friends. Even if there were places for me to go, I\\'m too scared of people to do anything other than sit at the side and avoid them. I have such big fantasies of finding love and it\\'s ridiculous because I can\\'t even say \"hi\" to a person.Looking back, it was easier to be in that messed up household with the family because I could always tell myself \"it\\'ll be better as soon as you get out\" it was something to keep hope alive. Now that I\\'m out and still as crippled as ever, what do I tell myself? \"It\\'ll get better if you just give it 6 months\"? I told myself that at 16, that it must get better, there was no way a person could feel like this for years and years, and now here I am more than a decade later feeling the same way. I STILL tell myself that, there\\'s no way I could possibly be 40 or 50 and still be like this, but I find threads on reddit all the time of 40 and 50 year olds talking about their lifelong depression.So many huge things about me that would have to change to feel better, when I\\'ve never even made progress on a single one. I\\'m going to be that 50 year old talking about how he was depressed since 14. Or maybe not, the money is going to run out in a year and I won\\'t even be able to be that 50 year old. No part of me believes I will ever be better, I never have been. I\\'ve never seen anyone like me that has gotten better. I haven\\'t even seen many like me that have lived this long, you don\\'t go 14 years wanting to die, you get better or you kill yourself much sooner than that.What the hell do I do? Everyone wants to just say keep hanging on, it\\'ll get better. But I do, and it doesn\\'t. How long are you supposed to hang on and keep fooling yourself into thinking it\\'ll ever be better? And would it matter? If I grit my teeth and live another 30 years so I can die of old age, crying all the way? My life is over, it never started. I knew that at 14. I was just too conflicted to kill myself because I hoped there would be some proof that it could get better. That\\'s what keeps me here now, because what if something happens tomorrow to change everything? So I struggle to tomorrow and nothing happens. At what point am I allowed to give up? And I sit here now writing this hoping someone can say something to help, but there is nothing. In 14 years of this I\\'ve heard it all and none of it has helped. There\\'s just nothing left.',\n",

Even as a child, before anything bad happened to me, I often felt a sick feeling of dread. It got worse when I was touched and injured by our old neighbor in elementary school. And even worse in middle school when my dad had a drug problem and our family fell apart. My mom and I always fought and things started getting really bad when I was about 15. That's when I made my first plan to kill myself but I chickened out. From ages 16 to 21, about 5 years, I dated the man I wanted to marry. He turned out to have schizophrenia. I spent years trying to help him get better but he left me. It's been 14 months since he left me but none of the pain has healed, I've only learned to bury it. He called me worthless and he was right, I am scum. I have no future, no goals, no hope of ever being loved. I will never be able to trust anyone. For a while I've been able to put off suicide by cutting, but I'm done with doing superficial damage, I want to destroy the entire body. I want it to be lights out for this pathetic, worthless, repulsive person that I can't believe is myself. I'm going to wait until I can see my parents and sisters one last time, so I can give them a happy last impression of me. In fact if I could find a way to make it look like an accident I would do so, because that's my only regret, that there's no way to do this that avoids hurting my family. But that's the way it has to be.Well, it's not my only regret. I guess I have a general sort of regret that I turned out to be a dud. The odds were so small that I was ever even born, it sucks that I failed to take advantage of what I had. At least it will be over soon and I can stop feeling guilty. Finally I will be out of people's hair. Finally I can stop working so hard just to keep living a life I hate. I'm glad I admitted this plan out loud, even if it was just to an Internet forum, it makes me feel calm to know the plan is in place and soon I won't be in pain anymore.

Sixteen hours of sleeping and wishing it was more permanent than that. I wish I was more impulsive (and less cowardly) so I could go ahead and swallow a shotgun and escape all this, rather than spend every day giving a sub-par performance at life and making those around me miserable too. What's the point of putting in the work to maintain my shitty version of life, when I hate it and spend every day wishing I was dead anyway? It's hard to do basic shit like going to work or taking a shower, when the whole time all I can think about is destroying myself. I only do it because I'm a coward and I'm not brave enough to pull the trigger. I pray I will be able to, one day, and soon\",\n",

I just want everything to be sorted out and for life to work my way. I'm depressed and have felt this way my entire life and know that age only makes life worse... Its official Its official Well all my problems bubble over and my only friend left leaves tomorrow and I can't handle being alone like this... The thought is killing me. Tomorrow feels like the final day. How do I go on? How do I go on? Life is too much to handle. There is never a good day in my life. All I do is work and sleep. I will never get over any of my problems even after so many years, its time to die, the shaking of the pills is calling me. I can't handle the struggle anymore. I can't handle the struggle anymore. Life is just not worth it anymore. I cry every single night I realize life has no way of getting better and everything ive ever wanted has passed. I just want to end it all. Why try? Why try? I can't handle this. I'm so alone and nothing in life will fix that. I'm ready for death, I'm tired of feeling like this for so many years... I'm done.\",\n",

       " ' Will thoughts of suicide ever be accepted by society? Will thoughts of suicide ever be accepted by society? Hello, I\\'m in my early 20\\'s and just going through another self loathing period. I\\'m use to it, it\\'s happened before, and I don\\'t see it being out of my life any time soon. In my most recent period of being down, I had reoccurring thoughts of suicide. Now, when I say this, I mean it in a sense that I believe many of us actually think about it. What would it mean if I killed myself, would it be worth it, how would it affect my loved ones etc. Now, I\\'ve been having these thoughts, and I feel okay with them. I\\'ve come close to acting out on them before, but not recently. However, the problem I see is that I can\\'t really think of talking to someone about my thoughts of suicide, just based on what people initially think. They will think that I need immediate help (which is thoughtful), but I feel as though just talking about it would be some sort of therapy in itself, something to help relieve myself. Yet, I really do think people commonly have thoughts of suicide. For me at least, it\\'s a common thought process which so far has always lead to the same conclusion, it\\'s not worth it. Also, I here people say that certain reasons are not \"good\" ones to commit suicide. Yet from what I understand, it\\'s totally subjective. My upbringing/biology/current environmental factors together create a unique thought process and experiences, in which I feel that suicide would be the best option.Two questions than:1) Do you believe that general thoughts of suicide as I described are common amongst the general _PERSON_) Do you feel right judging the reasons for oneself to commit suicide? (Can you say with confidence that one\\'s reasons may be \"nonsense\"?\"Not sure if this post is going to do much, but I just find getting my thoughts out to be relief enough.

I come to you with a desperate plea because I have no friends to confide in so I must confide with strangers on the Internet. At least you guys seem to be an amiable bunch that are more likely to help out than tell me to kill myself (which I have to admit has come across my mind more than a few times in the recent past). I\\'ve posted this on another subreddit and I don\\'t know your rules on multiple posting, but if I don\\'t get help soon, I fear what I might do.I need life advice. Ever since I\\'ve left high school, my life has been nothing but a string of failure after failure. I was originally accepted to the University of Waterloo in Ontario, for an ambitious program that combined a computer science degree with an accounting degree. I originally wanted to be just computer science, but with influence from my accountant mother, she encouraged me to take CompSci with Accounting.I moved out, then something in my head just switched. In high school, I was a responsible honor roll student who got all As with little to no effort. When I moved out, I just let go of everything. All my classes started failing, I got sucked into different computer games that sucked up all my time, starting with _PERSON_, then into League of Legends. After I moved out of the dorm without steady internet, I realized how wretched of a person I could become. I remember that after every class, instead of going somewhere to study, I went to one of the common rooms with my PC, mouse and mousepad ready, hooked up and just played League of Legends until an ungodly hour before returning to my room to sleep. I\\'ve also downloaded a porn game and fapped to it until 5 am in the morning, making me unable to go to class the next day.After a straight year of mediocre marks, my parents and I agreed that maybe Waterloo was too difficult of a university and that I should go to an easier university. Better to do well in a lesser university than to do bad in a good university right?Well, moving to York University initially wasn\\'t so bad. I did get good marks initially. But this year, I\\'ve once again failed my parents and myself. My League of Legends addiction stayed, causing me to play instead of studying, causing me to bomb my midterms on two of my major courses, causing me to drop one and end up getting a D in the other. I never paid attention in class, I was too proud and stupid to think that I needed to. \"I would read that on my own\" I said to myself, but I never did since my nights were filled with League. Since I also repeated an accounting course that I needed for an internship but didn\\'t get the mark I needed last semester, but since I kept forgetting to do online assignments and didn\\'t pay attention in class, I ended up getting a worse mark than before. I\\'m very lucky that the internship office said that they could make exceptions if my GPA was high enough.Now, with the beginning of my new semester, my ol\\' faithful ASUS laptop that fed my addiction to all of my video games for the past 4 years has died and I\\'ve managed to get some time to think about my life. I decided that I would start paying attention in class, start studying and stop playing so much games, especially since the laptop I have now can only play shitty games.However, my dad just talked to me about an hour before I typed this. He and my mom have been nothing but supportive of me throughout my failure at Waterloo, but my recent failings has recently driven them over the edge. My mom, who was usually a taskmaster behind me in high school and my main motivation for getting good marks often came from her, has become more dismissive and pessimistic about me and my schooling. My dad picked up on this and after hearing about me fucking up last semester has issued an ultimatum.If I don\\'t start pulling my marks up (and B\\'s are probably not going to cut it), he said that he no longer wanted to feel like a failure as a father and wants me to live alone. For the past 20 years of my life, he has offered nothing but support and fatherly advice, but I have never done any of it. I can\\'t blame him for wanting to kick me out. I\\'ve wasted so much money with my failure and appear to want nothing more but to play games all day and night.I don\\'t know what to do. I want to believe that I can study and do better in school, but I don\\'t know if I can at this point. I have already promised myself the same thing multiple times in the past, but I always seem to forget the strife and pain that I went through just a few months before and fall into old habits.I\\'ve already feel guilty about all the shit I\\'ve put my parents through and it\\'s beginning to affect my head. Ever since I\\'ve failed those midterms last semester, every time I go through any kind of emotional stress, I\\'ve been getting these intrusive thoughts in my head. \"Maybe you should just kill yourself,\" they say. After I hear these things in my head, I always find myself going down a train of thought analyzing the benefits of suicide, how it would help my parents not have to feel as failures anymore and how I wouldn\\'t have to worry about disappointing them anymore. I\\'m scared of what my own mind is doing that is seemingly out of my control.Even with suicidal thoughts and all of my parents efforts, I am very afraid of falling back into the cycle of improving, then forgetting and returning to old habits that will cause failure. I\\'m lost. I cannot tell anyone in my life about this. All of my friends wouldn\\'t know what to tell me and probably couldn\\'t tell me much but basic uplifting tropes and shit. I don\\'t want to put all of my emotional baggage on them. They don\\'t deserve it, they have their own lives to worry about.The only glimmer of hope I see is that I have been successfully working out at home using workout videos. Although most of my drive to get in shape was to get \"a pornstar body\" (I\\'m really fucking motivated by sex for some reason), it\\'s about the only good thing I have going for me. Hell, that might be the only way I could make money when my dad kicks me out and I have to start whoring my self out.Please, I need help. I need a third party to tell me what to do. I keep seeing the pattern of my life but I just can\\'t seem to break the cycle. With my dad about to kick me out, I\\'m really afraid that if I don\\'t pull my marks up and turn myself around, I may end up on the news no more than a year later as a dead man who hanged himself in a local alley.I\\'m not currently suicidal right now, but I know that if I can\\'t pull this life off soon, I will have good reason to be. Any kind of advice is needed, even if it\\'s just a redirection to a larger advice subreddit. I\\'ve tried to find one but Google didn\\'t help me this time. Please, I don\\'t know what to do.',\n",

I've been fighting an extremely powerful depression for about a year now.  My little foster brother died at age 11 in March 2014.  He was an innocent boy, played baseball for the local team, went to church, loved singing in the church musicals, and was super excited to be in band when he got old enough so he could be like me.  Then my stepfather died in September 2014 of lung cancer.  He was a very good man, took in my mom and us 3 boys after our father lost his mind to drugs and alcohol.  He wasn't very emotionally supportive but he helped us in ways I'm just now realizing.  He taught us how to fix basic issues with our car like oil/tire changes, fluid checks, etc.  He taught me how to set up a PC and how to make sure it's protected from viruses.  He taught us how to cook.  He was a great man that left behind two ex wives (one being my mom), two bio-daughters, and three stepsons.  I was doing okay after my foster brother died.  Then my stepdad died and I just fucking crashed.  I've been low since September and I can't get out of it.  I utterly failed a semester of college which put my graduation back a whole year, if it ever happens.  Nobody trusts me now, especially my professors.  I'm failing this semester too.  I'm just too fucking depressed to even get out of bed.  I don't even know why I would bother to go to college.  I'm a fucking bagboy at a grocery store at almost 23 years old, asking paper or plastic and pushing carts for minimum wage, and I can't even do that right.  There's no fucking way I can complete my major and be a teacher.  My mentor/good friend/ex-teacher wants me to graduate fast so I can work with her at my alma mater and take over for her when she leaves.  I don't know how to tell her she's placing her trust in a fucktard.  I'm dumb as a box of rocks.  I'm a drunk.  I'm an addict.  I'm unreliable.  I'm angry.  There's no way anybody will hire me with my college record.  I'm absolutely fucked on getting a real teaching job, if I ever graduate.  I'll probably just end up being a fucking bagboy for the rest of my life.  It doesn't help that all my friends are student teaching, getting ready to graduate, and auditioning for grad school.  And here I am, fucking five years into my degree already and a year behind.  Everybody I know will be graduating this semester and I'm stuck for another fucking year.  I quit my fraternity too, so I'll basically have no friends after May.  I'm gonna be stuck in a year of fucking loneliness.  I don't know why I should bother continuing school or why I should even bother living.  And my suicidal thoughts bring about a whole other level of guilt.  I can't fucking kill myself.  I have two brothers that I live with that depend on me emotionally, financially, and socially.  I have a fiancee that loves me and would be lost without me.  My mentor depends on me to take over her job when she moves on to bigger and better things.  My best friend is emotionally unstable and she depends on me to be her rock, and I love her more than words could ever say.  I'd be lost without that woman.  My mom needs me as the eldest child and the one that mediates between her and the younger boys.  So many people need me, but all I want to do is kill myself.  Why am I so fucking broken.

Im healthy and strong. I'm young and ambitious. Yet these days just getting sleep is the closest i get to relief.

But she will never change, we've tried a lot and are continuing treatment, but nothing seems to help very much. I still can't leave her alone.I can't do the things I enjoy, because I need to keep her as happy as possible at all times. no one else is willing to deal with her, mostly because her family is not a very good family, and she can be very stressful to be around sometimes. Her moods are erratic. But she means well all of the time, that's why I love her. She cares very much about other people.I don't know if I'm making sense, or if this is even the appropriate forum.

I do have pre existing mental health issues (Level I Bipolar Disorder) which I am medicated for.  When I inherited this money, the only people in this world who I considered friends wanted to go into business with me.  They kept asking me for money for this and that \"for the restaurant\"  they both held and still hold management positions at other restaurants.  I kept giving them money trusting people who I had known for years not to cheat me.  One then moved in with me without paying rent with a girlfriend and they got drunk and fought all the time and made it a very difficult place for me to live.  I eventually put my foot down and told them to pay their share or get out since my friends name was then on the lease too.  His solution was to call up a friend of his who I did not know who was a white supremacist who came over with two of his friends held a gun to my head and took all my valuables.  The police thought I was making the story up because I am mentally ill and that is what all my so called friends told them.  And my roommate talked to the apartment manager and had me kicked out since I now couldn\\'t pay rent and he mysteriously came up with his share and my share for his girlfriend to take over the lease.  These skinheads kept following me around for a few days and scaring me, and one day I come outside to my car having been stripped.

Her own family has told me she was sleeping with two married men while she was with me (our relationship lasted a month and we had only tried to sleep together that once) and her brother lives across the street from my new house and she camps out there all day long every day to torment me I feel.

I then started to think about all my problems and everything that I have been dealing with and although its all tough stuff, I feel a lot better about things today than I did yesterday.  I don\\'t know when things will get better but things aren\\'t truly bad enough to end my life.  I started talking to my family today and things are on better ground there.  I will be moving out, but it will be when the time is right.  I have done without a job for this long, so I can wait longer if I have to.  Things aren\\'t good, but I just needed some perspective to understand they could be worse.  Thank you for all your concern and everyone who cared enough to respond.  After a couple hours I may delete this post not due to emberassment but because I don\\'t want this to be the first thing people see when they check my profile.  Thank you all again. Thank you everyone.  The world is a better place because r/SuicideWatch exists, and its good to know there are people out there to talk to. Thank you everyone.  The world is a better place because r/SuicideWatch exists, and its good to know there are people out there to talk to. A few months ago when I was really down and depressed I posted here.  Things aren\\'t perfect but I am doing much better.  I think just having people here listen to me and let me know there are still good things and people in this world worth sticking around for helped me get out of that mindset.  Thank you all very much.',\n",
       " ' One last time. One last time. This is maybe my third time posting, previously on throwaways. Fuck it, no more hiding.I feel so stupid writing this. Most other people in this subreddit have real problems - abusive childhoods, traumatic experiences with awful breakups/deaths/losing their kids/pets etc. By comparison I\\'m flawless. So why do I want to die? It\\'s not even really that I want to die - I just don\\'t want to be around anymore. I want everything to be gone - myself included. If I wasn\\'t such a coward I would have already ended it all by now.I don\\'t even know where to start with all this. I have no friends. The one relationship I managed to find where I truly could be myself broke up recently because my ex-fiancee didn\\'t think we were compatible in the bedroom. We sold our house and now I am living in a hotel for a few months until my work visa expires and I have to return to my home country. I had to give up my pets.My body is hideous - scarred from cycles of rapid weight loss/gain over the years due to my binge eating to make myself feel better. The hobbies I once enjoyed no longer give me any pleasure. I have tried going to meetup groups and things to try and meet new people while doing the things I enjoy but these event always have cliques of people that already know each other and I can\\'t seem to break into any of them - I just end up sitting there alone and miserable until I just leave. I can\\'t even talk about my hobbies with regular people because I feel ashamed of them - they aren\\'t \"normal\" things like watching sports and bullshit like that.I hate my job. The company I work for used to be small where everyone knew and talked to each other. Now we have gotten so big, I run into the clique problem at work too - I have no-one to talk to or have lunch with anymore because there is no-one at my work that shares my interests. I can\\'t get in on any new projects at work because of changes in management - the new guy doesn\\'t seem to like me and won\\'t give me anything to do. All I do is fuck around on the internet all day and answer the odd question that people ask me. It\\'s gotten so bad that I don\\'t think I could actually do any real work now because I\\'ve been doing effectively nothing for years. It\\'s a good thing I\\'ve been with the company for so long or I probably would have been fired long ago.Every time I see or hear other people together being happy I switch between either wanting to die because I know I will never have that, and wishing they were dead so I didn\\'t have to see them and their happiness.Previously people on here have suggested stuff like adopting a kid or something. Yeah, great idea - I can\\'t even take care of myself let alone another living creature.My parents try to be supportive. My dad is a completely different person to me (if you\\'ve seen Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, it\\'s basically like Flint and his dad) and we don\\'t really have anything in common. He doesn\\'t know how to deal with any of this emotional stuff - he\\'s an old-fashioned guy. My mum went through depression herself when I was younger (though she hid it well - I never even knew until she told me when I was diagnosed with it) and tries to offer support but it\\'s like a broken record - the same unhelpful tips over and over again.The worst part is despite how bad I feel, I don\\'t even want to change anymore. I think I am beyond help. I just want to be left alone. If I\\'m left alone I can scrape by being miserable, barely. But being surrounded by other people having a good time and having a great life makes me want to run away and hide. How can I get better if I don\\'t even want to get better? Therapy has never helped because of this. I\\'ve been on meds but they always have bad side effects and are effectively a crutch - they mask the pain but don\\'t fix anything.So, this is my wall of text. If you read it all, sorry for wasting your time. I\\'m going to send my will to the family lawyer then head up to the Golden Gate Bridge tomorrow night and maybe jump off if I can muster the courage._PERSON_, I\\'m sorry I could never be the man you believed I could be. _PERSON_, while we have almost nothing in common I still love you - I\\'m sorry I wasn\\'t the son you wished you had. Madeline, I\\'m sorry I couldn\\'t give you what you wanted in the bedroom. _PERSON_, I\\'m sorry for breaking your heart all those years ago - if I hadn\\'t been such an idiot things might have turned out much differently. _PERSON_ - I\\'m sorry I was such a selfish friend over the years.Goodbye.',\n",

       " ' How to deal with this situation/ get out? Please here me out I beg of you How to deal with this situation/ get out? Please here me out I beg of you Okay people, this might be a long one and it might be a little disjointed because I\\'m trying to gather my thoughts together. I\\'m a 20 year old male ( will be 21 in July) and I believe I have a case of an nmom. I believe (I know for a fact) my mom has always resented me since birth because I wasn\\'t meant to happen (she stated that) and because she tried putting me up for adoption and the only reason why i wasn\\'t sent to an adoption home is because my great grandma (who was adopted kid) intervened and didnt want me to live a similar life to what she lived (I was told this in 10 grade and my mom dosent know I know this) and with that info it explains how she treats me compared to my older brother and in general . So let\\'s summarize my life and give an in depth description of my situation. Throughout my entire life my mom has always treated my brother better then me and has had an overall bias for him. Whether it be buying him new clothes and giving me hand me downs (which occurred all the way up til 11 grade due to me getting a \"job\") or just by the way she handled problems differently between us (I would get more severe punishments)  Another thing is she\\'s never really payed any attention to me (she saids I had good grades but I had a 2.5 gpa in highschool which I\\'ll explain) and I feel she takes out her anger on me due to her being in an abusive marriage and being diagnosed with bipolar and a few other things. First let me explain my highschool situation and then we\\'ll fast forward a bit. So in highschool in my freshman year literally the first day of school, I had the most embrassing thing happen to me and because of this it\\'s changed my life and shaped me as a person. On the first day of highschool in art class I pissed my shorts. It was so bad I skipped the next day of school but my brother told me that there was no escaping it because everybody was talking about it so he really didn\\'t want to associate himself with me (but he already didn\\'t associate himself with me due to being around the wrong crowd and getting a felony in middle school ) So throughout my highschool life I was ridiculed and made fun and I just couldn\\'t focus and I was afraid to talk to people because everyone knew it. I was depressed and had no friends there due to just moving  and to top it l off Im black (which I think race plays a part in your highschool life because there\\'s so many stereotypes and people just trying to fit in) So after highschool I proced to go technical school so I could transfer to a unviersty (I was thinking about going into the military at the back of my mind as a last resort , REMBER this) When I was looking for colleges with my mom she was surprised that I had such a low gpa which goes to show you how much attention she had for me. Anyway I was only able to complete one semester of college due to the fact that my mom received an oppurtunity to transfer location for her job a verison wireless to altanta which she took because she took because she wanted to \"be connected\" with the music industry because she a \"manager\" and if you don\\'t know a lot of black people speak highly of altanta. So anyway, I\\'m pretty much forced to go to altanta because just didn\\'t have any other option because if not I would of ended up like my brother who decided not to come (he\\'s living in a one bedroom apt living cautious due to the job he has not paying much) So I\\'m living in altanta now with my mom and not knowing the full situation until later. Because apprantly my mom was having half the rent payed by someone she was in a \"relationship\" with before which I thought was over because he was going to later move in lets just call him _PERSON_. So I\\'m just living life coped in my room withering away because I have no one to talk to, not getting any jobs due to never working, and not being able to go to college due to having no ride or license or even a damn permit. So it hit me \" I got to do something with my life because if not I won\\'t be shit, age 18\" so after 6 months of living in ga with nothing going for me I decided I wanted to join the navy (which I already brought it up to my mom previously) so I take the asvab and scored an 82 and was given a pact firemen job (which I didn\\'t want but took anyway due to the fact I needed to get out my situation because nobody was helping me) So the entire time this is happening my mom starts agitated due to the fact she probably knew the reason that I was leaving because of her. So throughout this period of waiting to get deployed she would start arguements with me and not take me to my DEP meeting forcing my petty officer to. So I finally get into basic training and realized that this life wasn\\'t for me so I tried to push myself but the thing that caught me was I didn\\'t know how to swim and because of that I was in boot camp for 4 months and emotionally broke down and got seperated. So when I made that phone call to my mom telling her what happen she was all supportive (which I think was just an act, because it was more of relief to her  that I tried to do sonething but failed and that I have to depend on her) So after being seperated im back at my moms house and to my surprise my uncle is here and _PERSON_. My mom told me she wanted me to relax on jumping straight into something and that she would help me once I decided to get back into things. So after living there for a few weeks i realized everything wrong with the situation of my mom moving to altanta. Because constantly my mom and _PERSON_ would argue and _PERSON_ would bring up the fact he was paying half the rent while not even living in the house and the fact my mom would never claim they were in a relationship publicly. And whenever either one wasn\\'t around they would talk shit about each other behind each other backs to my uncle, (also when they would argue _PERSON_ would not pay rent out of spite) the whole time im just the non existent one. Fast Forward to my CURRENT SITUATION my mom ends up getting in a relationship with another dude while she was still clinging on to  _PERSON_ (using him for rent) , so _PERSON_ just saids fuck it and moves out and lost all contact with my mom. Now lets get to the bs since my mom is with her new boyfriend lets call him _PERSON_ she has made it very apprant that she dosent like me by talking shit about me to _PERSON_, my brother, _PERSON_s two daughters and my uncle. And when ask her for help she saids \"you\\'ll get no where in life depending on people\" (because she knows I need her help and she\\'s going out of her way to not help me). it\\'s gotten worse because I confronted her about how she talks shit about me (she responded with im just venting, my ass) and isn\\'t really trying to help me, and how it\\'s because of her that my brother  just ignores me. Which didn\\'t work out because this N just disregarded all the points I made and said I disrespected her and proceded to tell my brother, my uncle, and _PERSON_ just so they can have a reason to not help me and to justify the way she treats me. So pretty since my nmom has a stable source of income to leech on she no longer feels the need to pretend to care about me because before with _PERSON_ she still needed me just i case everything hit the fan. So what the fuck do I do, I literally have nothing. Sorry for the long story and disjointness, if there is anything you don\\'t understand/ need more info on just tell me. ~Haze•To Summarize: mom never really liked me, I tried going to the miltaty to get away, emotionally broke down and got seperated, came back and is now dealing with my mom slandering me behind my back and giving people reasons to hate me to justify her reasons of treating me this way. Then I\\'ve never had a job, I never got a drivers license, I don\\'t have a car, and my mom can\\'t take me to technical college and I can\\'t go to a university because of my low gpa and not taking an ACT or SAT Tomorrow will be my birthday Tomorrow will be my birthday In 20 minutes (July 29) will be my birthday. If you don\\'t remember me I made this post _URL_  Also more negative stuff has happened since then, my mom saying \"she doesn\\'t care about my situation and i need to get the f out\" then dening she said that and slapping me in the face, and she still is constantly shit talking about me, I have nothing I can do, I honestly feel like killing myself on my birthday. Really don\\'t see any other options at this point.',\n",

       " \" Worst I've ever felt. Worst I've ever felt. Just a general rant. In an incredibly dark place right now, from the UK and been up most of the night - can't remember the last time I slept more than 4 hours.Ok so started on some new anti-depressants a few weeks ago and thought they were working. Last week I felt a bit like my old self, like the depression was starting to lift. Then I woke up friday morning and felt like I'd hit absolute rock bottom - haven't left this dark place ever since.Tried to kill myself yesterday and now my family know the true extent of my depression - brought embarrassment onto myself and my family. Came home to my boyfriend - well, now ex - having packed up all my things and asking me to move out. Absolutely devastated. Do you think after some time and space he would consider talking to me again? Anyone had similar experiences? I just want to call him and it's so hard not to but I know I shouldn't (and I won't). To be honest the main reason I didn't go through with suicide yesterday is because I know he would feel guilty for not being able to stop me and I couldn't leave this world knowing he felt like that. :'(Now living at my mums again and she's scared to leave me on my own. But I just want to be left alone and feel shitty, nothing can or is ever going to help. Off to see some pychologist in a few hours which terrifies me. I'm a 3rd year nursing student but is sure they're going to throw me off my course now because of this bastard depression.Just a huge mess. I feel like I made a mistake not going through with it. I just want to be happy - but I think I'm just one of those people born that can't be happy. Literally the world's biggest fuck up. Literally the world's biggest fuck up. Ok apologies in advance for this message, it's pretty much just a huge rant.Where to start? Tough upbringing of parents who were constantly on/off until they finally got divorced last year. During my teenage years they both hit me many times, ended up with bruises and broken bones, particularly from my mum. I have forgiven them now but it has shaped me into a person I do not like. I have suffered from depression for a while, officially diagnosed in January after trying to commit suicide, I feel like I can't go on anymore.I'm a 20 year old female, I like to think I'm a nice person. Would literally do anything for anyone. For the past 3 years I have been training to be a nurse. I love the job but due to certain events I'm having to give it up (read below).Ok so Saturday I got into a huge argument with my (ex) boyfriend of 2 1/2 years. We had been dodgy for a while but I fucked up hugely. I lost my temper and hit out at him, more than once. It was like I had no control - that isn't an excuse but I just felt like I saw red and the second it clicked in my head what had happened I stopped immediately and since then I have been disgusted in myself. It's like what my parents used to do with me and I've learnt their awful behaviour. I know I have probably ruined things for good but I really just can't see myself moving forward. I love him beyond believe and am hurting so much. I'm so ashamed in my behaviour and I understand why he would never want me back but I would literally do anything to be with him. I believe, for many reasons, he is the one and I don't want anyone else. He makes me so happy and I'm just a huge screw up.Then the shittest news of all. On Monday I was diagnosed with bowel cancer. After much deliberation I have decided to no go ahead with treatment. It feels like I'm genuinely just never meant to be happy. I can't go through the pain of treatment as well as heartache at the same time. I was meant to have an operation today but cancelled it because I don't feel the money should be spent on me (I'm from the UK, NHS should spend their money on somebody more worthwhile). I have made a bucket list and want to tick off some things then kill myself before I get too ill to do it. It's like all this shitty stuff is just going to continue happening and I'd rather have a happy 6 months than a shitty x amount of years.Fuck cancer. Fuck life. Can't do this anymore. A quick thank you ... A quick thank you ... Thanks for all the help you gave me over the past 6 months, you gave me moments of happiness that I never thought I'd see.I can't deal with my heart being broken, a diagnosis of cancer or my depression anymore. You did extend my life but I've officially given up now. Went on for as long as I could, faked a smile for so long, but tonight is the night for me to slip away. Thanks again and all the best to you all. xx\",\n",

I want to kill myself so bad but I know I can never get the courage to do it myself so all iv been thinking about is if I got into a bad enough car accident or motorcycle accident. Every time I get into my car or hop on my bike I kinda hope in the back of my head that someone just swerves at me. Im 22 years old and I have done nothing with my life. I got a bunch of money from a lawsuit from breaking my back in a car accident and basically blew almost half of it. My dad left our family about the time I broke my back and ever since this year we dont really have a relationship and he always talks shit about me and my family. Since he left we cant afford our house and we had to sell it and now we were staying at my aunts this month and tomorrow my mom gets to move into her new apartment with my brother and sister. There arent enough rooms so I have to sleep on the couch. We would probably have a much nicer place if my mom wasnt an alcoholic. She is extremely irresponsible and I did this whole moving thing extremely wrong.I actually wasnt even supposed to move in with her, I was supposed to move to Illinois (I live in NJ) with my fiance to get our own place and hopefully start my new life but we got into a huge fight today. I was actually supposed to pick up the moving truck tomorrow but im gonna have to cancel it. Not to mention on top of that I have to give away my dog because the place isnt pet friendly. My mom is supposed to move in 2 days and I still have no idea where the dog is going because I kinda almost made myself not believe it and kept putting it to the side.My fiance just found out today that her sister who she hates to the point where she wants her dead has uterine cancer. Shes been treating me like shit this entire day, and when shes mad I kinda feel like her punching bag so if shes upset about her sister shes definitely taking it out on me. The last thing shes basically said was calling me a loser and to enjoy sleeping on my mothers couch because I blew up her phone for like an hour and kept asking her what I did to deserve the treatment she was giving me. So I guess you can say shes playing a decent role to why im so fucked up right now.On top of all this I think I can say I have an addiction to pain pills and benzos. _PERSON_ been on and off them for like 2 years but the past few months its gotten worse. I had to of spent at least a grand in the past couple months. I don think I can live without benzos because its the only thing that helps me be more social. I dont have a job, I didnt go to college. I just feel like a burnout. I dont have much family to turn to and im lucky to have my friends because if I didnt I probably would have the guts to take my own life.I feel like iv just been bitching this entire thread. I dont know whats wrong with me, the more time goes by the more I think im fucked up in the head. I just dont see a positive future for myself and I rather just forget it all and be dead.',\n",

I've come here to support you all, but by providing that support you guys are helping me deal with these emotions too.  It has been a really crazy and honestly a messed up year for me so far.  On February 19^rd one of my good friends decided to take his life.  This was exactly 6 days after he became an adult.  That's 6 days of living life as a supposed free man.  He had troubles with depression, honestly he was too smart for himself.  He knew what was going on internally and felt there was no escape.There was a way though.  He was very private about his emotions and condition.  I truly feel that if he was open to sharing these thoughts with others, the possibility to cure himself was there.  Everybody I know loved this kid, and we still do, but it hurts that he isn't here in physical form to show that love.Only two weeks later a teen I had little personal connection to committed suicide also.  I had texted him a few times, and he seemed like an extremely happy and wonderful guy.  Yet he hid his true emotions and feelings of despair.  I think about both of these guys almost every day, sometimes many times a day.So I guess what I'm trying to get at is if you feel like there is no way out, take a minute to find someone to talk to.  Don't be scared about how people will see these emotions.  I challenge each and everyone of you on this subreddit to tell one person how you feel about them or even what is on your mind.  I think the power of communication and connection is enough to help save lives.  If anyone needs help dealing with anything, please, PM whatever you need.

In fact, I don't think I ever had them, not truly. I've held a loaded gun and contemplated it, but it wasn't like I didn't want to live. I was just indifferent.Anyway, these days I have a great life, or at least that's what I tell myself. I live in a pretty house, have lots of nice friends I can trust, a beautiful girlfriend, just started Engineering school in one of the best universities in my country and am learning French in one of the best language course institutions in my state.The thing is, for a few years, I haven't been feeling happy. I really have a great life, and I keep telling myself I can't say I'm not happy, because I have so much. But lately... It's been fucked up.My whole life I was told by my family how smart I am, how my grades meant I was intelligent. I entered Engineering school, as mentioned, which in my country is kinda hard, but now I can't keep up. My grades are amongst the lowest. I haven't had true appetite for food for a few weeks. I only feel any joy around my friends and girlfriend, and even then, when they're telling stories, I always feel really bad because my life has been so uneventful. When they were going to parties, I was home on the Internet. My family can only be described as dysfunctional, and I don't trust them for almost anything(with reason).  Right now, I've stopped studying because I didn't know something. My tests are tomorrow and after. I turned off my phone to see if my gf will call me, and thus, call her attention, even though I don't tell her how I truly feel. I'm just sitting in the dark watching time goes by, not even music lights me up right now. It's not that I want to die, it's just I want to skip to a better time in life. A time when I'm not a house-staying boring nerd anymore.The only time I truly feel well is when I make someone happy. As in, not making people laugh,something cute for my gf. I mean getting the homeless some food, helping an old lady carry her bags randomly, take a blind man to his bus stop across the bus terminal. It's just, I don't even do *that* a lot.Thank you if you read this far. Right now, I have nothing else to say. Truly, thank you.

I\\'ve tried talking to a couple of people but they just can\\'t begin to understand the depths of what I\\'m dealing with; to them, I\\'m just defeatist, just being difficult, just choosing to remain unhappy when I could so easily find some way to \"get _PERSON_ family is deeply religious; I\\'m an atheist. I can\\'t talk to them anymore because all they want to do is preach to me about how if I would just turn to God all this would go away.So here I am... I\\'m not ready to do anything yet, but I\\'ve been down this road far too many times over the past decade, and I know the warning signs. It won\\'t take long before I\\'m making serious preparations for being gone.I feel abandoned and alone, like nobody would ever *want* to care. Like all I do is frustrate everyone around me until they give up on me in disgust... or maybe just keep banging their heads against the brick wall of the disease out of some twisted sense of biological obligation.I just want to feel like someone gives a shit.It should say plenty about my state of mind that I\\'m turning to a community of anonymous strangers for support.I don\\'t know what to do anymore, so here it is. Anything you\\'ve got is deeply appreciated. Back again... and running out of time Back again... and running out of time Nights have always been the worst for me. Occasionally things will get bad during the day, but night is usually when it crops up.I feel torn on being here tonight. I\\'m a fiercely independent person, and scrabbling around for bits of help from Internet strangers runs deeply counter to that. I feel like I\\'m wasting people\\'s time, chewing up attention, being melodramatic... like there\\'s other people out there who are in serious imminent danger of hurting themselves who deserve the help more than I do. I know I won\\'t do anything tonight, except maybe tear up my wrists some more, but I\\'m not going to die yet... so why am I wasting space with this? I don\\'t know.Maybe it\\'s just part of the disease, maybe it\\'s just a side effect of the deepening blackness that has become my life, maybe I\\'m wrong. But if you have any question about whether to spend your concern on me or someone else, make it someone else. I think part of me just wants the attention.For a number of reasons, I learned from a young age to be a very good actor. I can take on any number of different personae, become an outwardly totally different person at will. I abuse this skill constantly to keep people around me from knowing the truth of my situation. A few people know bits and pieces, but nobody knows the whole story - not my family, not my doctor, not my best friend.I guess I feel like if anyone knew the truth, they wouldn\\'t *want* to care. I feel like no matter what I do, nobody will want to be around the real me. So I lie. I\\'m a damned good liar. But that\\'s just one more reason why I can\\'t accept the idea that someone would be able to tolerate me - if people knew how much I distort the truth, how could they possibly put up with the strain of constantly wondering if I\\'m being honest?I\\'ve *almost* resigned myself to the strong possibility that I will carry out the rest of my life alone, just as I am now. The problem is, I know I\\'m strong enough to survive it, and even be successful - so I can face that prospect and accept it, even thrive on it to some extent. But I desperately, secretly hope that isn\\'t how it all goes down.Anyways... if you bothered to read all of that little bitch-fest, I\\'m sorry for wasting your time.I feel like a whore for even doing this. I am so, so tired of fighting this. I am so, so tired of fighting this. I don\\'t even really know what to say anymore.A big part of me hates complaining about things, for a number of varied reasons. So it\\'s hard to come here and just whine and bitch for no real purpose. Unfortunately, I feel like that\\'s the best recourse I have right now.Everyone I know is either asleep or too busy to get involved. It figures that the one time that is really hard for me (nights) has to overlap directly with the time when the fewest people are available to be there. When it\\'s easy for people to help, I don\\'t need it; but when it requires going a little bit out of their way, they won\\'t do it, and naturally that\\'s when I\\'m the most desperate. The feelings of despair and abandonment just feed themselves on this irony.I feel like I lack the energy and desire to continue fighting. I\\'m still cycling between deep depression and hypomania, often within the space of a few hours. It\\'s so exhausting. Worse, it\\'s virtually impossible to treat with medication - the drugs take far too long to kick in and address only one half of the equation. The best I can do is ride it out. There\\'s no hope for eliminating the symptoms entirely; I\\'ll be stuck with this pattern for the rest of my life.Sure, I may have periods of stability and lucidity; I may go for months at a time with no problems, as I did earlier this year. But looming in the back of my mind is the constant reminder that someday I\\'ll have to go through it all again - the aching, the anger, the fear, the rush, the buzz, the high, the cutting, the self-medicating, the long nights of trying to talk myself out of hospitalization or even being fully committed.I am so very tired of this. Even as I sit here, wide awake against my wishes and full of energy, I\\'m drained past the point of being empty. I haven\\'t just given it all I\\'ve got - I\\'m in debt. And I have no idea how to find my way back to stability and normalcy.I\\'ve started making my final plans. I\\'m working on a checklist of all the loose ends I want to tie up before I go, and all the people I need to write to. I know how devastating it will be when I finally check out. I\\'m under no illusions that this will make things better for anyone but me. Call me selfish if you want; if ending the most miserable state of existence I can fathom is selfish, then so be it - I\\'m an asshole. But isn\\'t it just as selfish for everyone else in my life to demand that I stay in this state forever, just so they can avoid the pain of losing me? Who is really making the more selfish demands here?Some of my friends need to know what they\\'ve done to help - because they *have* helped. A few others need a swift kick in the ass for being more or less useless. My family is probably the hardest one; despite their misguided attempts to drown me in religion as a cure for all this, they at least care enough to *try* something. I want my doctor to know that I think he did his best with the material he had available, and that I don\\'t think of this as a failure on his part at all.This is entirely my own decision.I don\\'t know why I\\'m even posting this. Maybe it\\'s to struggle for some last illusion of having someone here to fight with me. Maybe I just don\\'t want to disappear into oblivion when the time comes, and this is my way of leaving a trace of who I am and what happened to me.Maybe it\\'s just a totally self-indulgent smear of pathetic ink at the end of the otherwise forgettable page.I think my biggest regret is that I\\'ll probably wake up again tomorrow. Pseudonymous prattle, which you should read. Pseudonymous prattle, which you should read. I almost posted this using my normal account, because part of me really wants it to be known what\\'s going on. I really can\\'t fully justify my decision to remain anonymous; it does interfere with the possibility of someone directly being able to assist in the situation. But anything is better than nothing, and I\\'m facing some scrutiny at the moment for new-job-purposes, so I don\\'t need this crap of all things showing up and complicating matters.The truth is, I\\'m skating a fine and dangerous line in my life at the moment, and the excess pressure has built to the point where it needs to vent or I\\'ll rupture some capillaries in some vital location. Ordinarily this is the kind of thing you take to your friends. Or your family. Or your religious compatriots. Or whatever. This is not the sort of shit which is appropriate, normal, or healthy to unload in public to a bunch of strangers on a medium like the Internet. Chances are this little nugget is going to haunt me for a long time [or would have if I\\'d attached my real name to it].But I\\'m well past caring, and deeply reckless at the moment. So I\\'m gonna do it anyways, and you get to point and laugh. Win/win, right? Everyone loves a hit of schadenfreude.My friends are, to a person, in no position to do anything at this point. My family doesn\\'t need any extra baggage to cope with either. I find no particular appeal in sitting in a dark wooden booth talking to a priest, for a number of reasons, not least of which being that I\\'m an atheist and place no stock in the mental competence of the professional clergy. There\\'s always doctors, but they\\'re expensive, and even the good ones don\\'t make house calls at 2:30 AM. Short of buying a stuffed ostrich and seeking its counsel, I\\'m low on alternatives, although one could make a pretty good case that talking to a toy bird is less insane than journaling about this on the web.It\\'s hard to contextualize a weekend in which you\\'ve alternated - more times than can be counted - between feeling like the second incarnation of the Christ and seriously pondering chambering a round and finding out if you\\'ll have enough remaining milliseconds of consciousness hear the sound of your own grey matter covering the walls. There are points where the two just overlap, and in some twisted psychological paradox, you hate yourself for being so happy and are overjoyed at being so miserable.To be sure, they make medication for this. I have a really nice prescription for some of it (four of them, in fact). But there\\'s a minor problem here known as non-compliance. Some people have reasons for not popping their daily dose. I don\\'t. One of the most deeply frustrating aspects of my condition is the fundamental conflict between my pragmatic, analytical nature and my refusal to expend a minimal amount of effort every morning to stave off the onset of what is likely the most traumatic and terrifying mental experience a human being can ever endure. There is no rational reason - hell, not even a poorly supported, emotional, irrational reason - for metaphorically playing Russian Roulette with a semi-automatic, and yet here I sit, staring down the maw of pathological chronic psychosis... and twenty feet away on the counter lies an unfilled prescription dated sometime in January.I\\'d be lying if I told you that I don\\'t love every minute of it. There is a thrill to flirting with this that is unlike any adrenaline addiction in the world. The fact of the matter is, I look forward to it. There is no drug that can touch this. Words flow; I can\\'t write like this \"normally.\" Code flows, too; my most inspired and beautiful creations are spawned from the primordial ooze of psychological pandemonium. I write my best music at times like these.Sure, there\\'s irritability, short term memory loss, all the side effects of chronic sleep deprivation, and of course the actual life consequences of all the monumental stupidity one commits when in this state. It\\'s tough to explain the twelve parallel scars on your forearm, for instance. I presume it\\'s just as tough to explain why you were doing 120MPH down the interstate, although I have yet to actually be forced to account for that particular idiocy.But none of that matters. All that\\'s important is riding the high, staying blitzed out of your mind, wringing every last drop of maniacal pleasure out of the tortured and rapidly fraying rag of your life. The stupidity is eclipsed by an all-consuming hedonistic obsession. If it feels good, do it to obscene excess. I don\\'t normally drink much, but my liquor supply is dwindling at an alarming rate these days. I don\\'t think I\\'ve smoked as much in the past five months as I have in the last five days. There\\'s some suspiciously fist-shaped dents in the walls now, which correspond in interesting ways with the occurrence of thirty-hour Halo marathon sessions. (Some of those dents are celebratory, but mostly they\\'re the lingering testament to unremembered episodes of blind rage. Depends on how many games I won and how many I lost.)If I weren\\'t socially dysfunctional and living the middle of the most ass-backwards conservative part of the country, I\\'d probably be treading water right next to Hank Moody in his proverbial sea of pointless pussy. To be honest I\\'m not sure if I\\'m more annoyed or relieved that I\\'m not on a rampant sex binge right now; God knows I more or less have substituted testosterone for all my blood at this point. Probably best to keep the destructive chaos of my problems confined to myself, I suppose... no sense in ensnaring some poor innocent chain of women in my disintegrating mass of lunacy. (I daresay they might find the experience worth it, but I can only justify that argument by breaking into some truly lurid speculation at what I\\'d do with a suitably attractive female and her delicious little body right now; and this is SW, not some trashy erotic fiction board, and in any case I\\'m so delusional right now that it\\'s probably not true anyways.)Of course all this raises an important question: why am I here in the first place? I don\\'t even know if I want help. I\\'m fairly sure that I\\'m running entirely on id at this point and all I really am after is attention. (OK, let\\'s be honest. I want some gorgeous young thing to read this and fall hopelessly head over heels for my prose, be deeply moved by my emotional plight, and make it her dedicated life goal to cure all my worldly ailments by means of frequent raunchy sex.)But it felt good to say all this, and in a weird sort of way, it\\'ll feel good to think that someone read it. Even if nobody really does.Because right now, the anonymous, faceless internet seems to offer more in the way of genuine interest and compassion than all the individuals I can name put together. I\\'m also deep in a rut of ignoring the advice and care of everyone around me anyways, as if somehow it only counts if it comes from someone who doesn\\'t know me for real. I have no idea if the people in my life actually do give a shit or not, although I have to confess that the patterns indicate a gut-wrenching trend of them running for the hills as soon as I start getting weird. (Fuck you, _PERSON_, by the way. You\\'re a low-down liar and you nearly cost this world a precious life because of it. If I could bring my broken heart to wish upon you a greater misfortune than having to live out your life drenched in the guilt of what you did to me, I would.)When it comes down to it, I\\'ve always sort of idolized the Hollywood image of the battered, scarred hero, shrouded in bandages and comatose in some anonymous hospital bed. It\\'s as close as you can get to actually seeing who shows up (and who cries) at your own funeral. I guess I just want the satisfaction of knowing that someone would really be broken up if I decided it was time for an experiment in lead-powered trepanation.And hell, if the silver screen can be trusted, we all know that the ladies dig guys with incurable diseases. At least, I hope so, because that way my sorry ass might actually find someone who gives a fuck someday.And with that, I think I\\'ve indulged myself enough, and certainly probably lost your interest a long time ago anyways. So there you have it. I\\'m not going to think up a melodramatic line. Read this anyways. I\\'m not going to think up a melodramatic line. Read this anyways. I feel like a goddamn fixture in this joint.Maybe it\\'s therapeutic. God knows I need the therapy, in pretty much any form I can find. Maybe it\\'s just shameless attention whoring. I\\'m not going to lie, it\\'s kind of cool to labor under the illusion that someone on this shitty rock cares about you for a few hours. Then of course I remember that it\\'s just reddit and nobody hear really knows anything about me, and I can curl back up into the warm comfort of my eternal self-loathing and despair.Don\\'t let me stop you, of course; when you say nice things about me, both of us feel better. You probably moreso than me. Just understand that I\\'m going to believe you for all of a fraction of a happy second, and then go back to being convinced that the universe would be vastly improved after my removal from it.A few days ago I was in here raving up a storm about all kinds of things. That\\'s mania for you. To be frank, I only posted that because I knew that this time was coming. I knew that the high would pass and leave in its wake the utter despondency and misery of depression. It always happens this way.I wanted to get back in the habit of lurking around SW, because I knew that sooner or later the piper would come round with his smartly printed invoice, and demand his due. Well... bitch didn\\'t just come for the rent money, bitch brought the pimp and the posse. I used to think the Mafia had some great lien-less collection methods (kneecapping comes to mind) but this crowd could make _PERSON_ happily proclaim to be an atheist.In short... I find myself back in the place I\\'ve visited so many times before. Back in that delectable little spot that subsumes all light and hope in a way that \"black\" just can\\'t begin to describe. My trusty _PERSON_ knife is waiting for me across the room, begging in a sensuous sort of way to reignite our old passions and spill that blood just one more time. And in all fairness, the scars _are_ starting to fade a bit... and I wouldn\\'t want them to get lonely.Knives are for amateurs, though. Why lay around in a puddle of your own neglect and hatred, waiting for someone to inevitably notice and call 911? Why give fate the chance to fuck you over one last time, and deprive you of the one thing that would satisfy?I believe in doing things once, and doing them right. Don\\'t leave room for questions or mistakes or second thoughts.All I really want to know is whether or not I\\'d have the chance to see the flash, hear the sound, feel the rapid exit of brain from cranium as the bullet wends its oblivious way into the wall behind me. I\\'d be rather disappointed if the lights just went out with no fanfare.My only regret would be that I wouldn\\'t live long enough to really absorb the understanding of what it means to be dead.There\\'s a practical dilemma, of course, and that is not so much the selection of the _type_ of tool, but which _particular_ one. My 9mm pistol is a beautiful piece of art and would make a very ergonomic (albeit somewhat cliche) means of settling matters. But I certainly don\\'t want to neglect the assault rifle, either; it\\'s an elegant and powerful creation all its own, and bears more than a little sentimental value.My most difficult choice right now involves determining which of my weapons I want to disappoint by _not_ choosing it to silence the maelstrom of agony. Too bad I\\'m not coordinated enough to shoot myself with both at the same time.You\\'re already preparing the same trite old response that gets recycled like so much newspaper around here. Don\\'t do it. There\\'s good in the world, stuff that\\'s worth living for. It would hurt too many people, more than one might imagine. Taking yourself from this realm would constitute a tragic loss for us all._PERSON_.I\\'m a gangrenous limb. Better to be amputated and save the innocent remainder of the body from inevitable death by infection than to prolong the agony and pain over a little bit of sentimental attachment. Cauterization is ugly, but ultimately it spares that which remains from a fate worse than a scar.If there really is good in the world, keep it for yourselves. At least that way someone will be able to enjoy it. I\\'m beyond that. In the rare cases when something good has been within my grasp, I\\'ve stopped at nothing to banish it from my presence with as much haste and hate as I can muster.I\\'m in the final stages of negotiation for a new job. Double the salary, ridiculous benefits, vastly improved career prospects. I have good friends, good people. A family. Nice car. Own a house. No outstanding debt (aside from the mortgage) and no substantial criminal record. Nothing to run from, nothing to bury and hope to never revisit. By most standards, I\\'m pretty successful.It\\'s wasted.I hate all of it, I resent everyone, and the few people crazy or genuinely decent enough to get involved in my life are inevitably told to go die in a fire, because I\\'m terrified of anyone actually caring about me. Such a delicious contradiction... the only thing I want is to feel like I matter to someone, and yet I\\'ll stop at nothing to make myself as onerous and hateful as I can. I refuse to let anyone provide the one thing that would do me any good.I crave the involvement of the perfect woman, someone to be strong for me when I cannot be strong for myself, to care and listen and advise and just exist when those things are necessary. I ache for someone I can cherish for her inner and outer beauty, for all the things that make us so perfect and imperfect and irredeemable and invaluable as human beings. And I am terrified for the inescapable moment when I would lie awake at night, arms around her, smelling the hint of recently visited surf on her midnight hair, look into those eyes like pine needles through morning fog... and hate her for loving me.I\\'m beyond help, beyond hope, and I want to be told that I am wrong so I can laugh at your hollow consolation and retreat ever further into the certainty of my worthlessness.I will captivate and exploit every precious second of your attention that I possibly can, by weaving words in the only way I know how, and I will loathe you for listening to my pretentious drivel. I will spend hours polishing every last turn of phrase so I can detest you for being impressed by my oratory. I will spill out every drop of my soul onto the unfeeling tarmac and mock you for empathetically trying to turn the stains back into a person who once was whole.I will post a litany of disgusting prose to SuicideWatch, and I will reject and deflect every response I get, knowing that every best attempt at helping me will serve only to make me more convinced that I am beyond any help.And I will secretly hope that none of that will stop you.Because I will secretly hope that one of you will find it in you to stop me. The dimensions of freedom are 5.56x45mm. The dimensions of freedom are 5.56x45mm. About ten feet away in my closet, there\\'s an alluring collection of items that promises to solve everything. The key players include one AR-15 carbine in a hard-shell carrying case, four polymer magazines, and twelve rounds of 5.56 FMJ ammunition. The promise is a lie, but it doesn\\'t matter how many times you tell yourself it\\'s a lie if you still want to believe it.I could disassemble and reassemble that rifle blindfolded and in my sleep. I can land a ten shot group in an area the size of a quarter at twenty-five yards even without the assistance of the 9-power scope mounted on the upper rail. At a time when it feels like I\\'ve lost the mental capacity to do even menial tasks, when it takes more effort than I can summon just to change my socks, when I have no clarity to see even a few minutes into the future - this is all the comfort I have. I know that no matter how far my mind may be gone, how ruined and exhausted and broken my body may become, I will still have what it takes to make one final shot at point blank range.I have watched my life deteriorate rapidly over the past few weeks. All the patterns are there, so ingrained and familiar that I plunge into them unconsciously, utterly unaware of the progression until after it\\'s too late. The medication has run out and I made no effort to secure a fresh prescription. The bills are piling up and the collections agencies have flooded my inbound calls list on my cell phone. I\\'ve carefully dismantled the very few supporting relationships I have left, alienating and driving away everyone who might be around to interfere with the decline. Everyone has been carefully manipulated and misdirected until they look the other way; even those who should know the warning signs are oblivious, because I\\'ve meticulously concealed the reality of the situation - or, sometimes, outright lied about it to divert their attention.This is not my first rodeo. I\\'ve warred with myself for the better part of 14 years, always swinging back and forth between wanting to be OK and wanting to plant a knife in my jugular. I\\'ve spent countless nights holding those knives, lying paralyzed on the floor and scrounging for any last ounce of resistance even as I tell myself over and over that all I want is to be done with the whole thing. Sometimes I\\'ll pick one of my guns, take it apart, clean it, put it back together, rinse, repeat, hours of monotonous flirtation with the thing I want to do most and the thing I want above all to never do.It was supposed to get better. New treatments. New doctors. New home. New job. Fresh starts on all fronts, opportunities to succeed where I\\'ve destroyed myself before. I have no reason to want to quit life. No horrible past, no guilty conscience, no unspeakable trauma. I have no excuse for feeling this. Knowing that it makes no sense does nothing to calm the screaming agony that insists that I do not belong here. Knowing that it makes no sense simply removes all hope of finding a way to make life worth hanging on to.Above all else, I\\'m tired. Tired of fighting, resisting, hoping. Tired of clutching at the ribbons of the life I\\'m not even sure I want to keep. Tired of spending one day stubbornly surviving and the next day slicing new grooves into my arms. Tired of inwardly craving someone, anyone, to come along and care, while outwardly weaving a revolting image of someone that nobody could ever bring themselves to care about. Tired of feeling like I shouldn\\'t bother reaching out for help, because I don\\'t deserve to be helped.As with so many times before, being tired will probably be my salvation. I will fall asleep before I find the energy to accomplish my exit. And then I will feel even worse - for failing, for crying wolf, for wasting the time and concern and attention of anyone who happens to look in at the right moment. I will be back: at work, pretending nothing is wrong; at home, curled up on the floor in a dark room, alone with my twisted mind; here, begging for something I can\\'t even name, and knowing that in all likelihood I will reject whatever is offered.I can\\'t ignore the problem. I hate the thought of eroding away in an anonymous hospital. I\\'m not even sure I want to be OK anymore. I want out, and I have the ticket, but I don\\'t have the crucial piece of whatever it is that would let me cash it in.Sometimes I feel pain. Sometimes I feel anger. Sometimes I feel loneliness, or guilt, or regret, or whatever else. But this time all I feel is desperation and deep disgust. I hate my reality and I hate myself for allowing it to become real. I hate staying alive and I hate the thought of being gone.I am a prisoner of my own mind, and the warden is cruel.I\\'m skeptical that anyone will read all of this, or bother to be moved on my behalf, or bother to reply even just to say that someone\\'s paying attention. I don\\'t feel like I\\'m worth any of that. I don\\'t know what will happen, what I will do, how I will feel if and when I wake up tomorrow. I don\\'t even know if I want this to improve.I don\\'t know if I will hate myself more for posting this, or for deleting it and simply suffering in silence and anonymity.I am so lost in all of this. I will probably tell you that I don\\'t want your help.Please don\\'t listen. She\\'ll never hold me as the world disintegrates She\\'ll never hold me as the world disintegrates I\\'ve confessed an awful lot here in the past. _PERSON_ things that I\\'ve never managed to elucidate anywhere else. Told whole truths instead of the carefully manipulated half-lies that everyone else hears. Revealed things that no one who knows me could even imagine. And yet there\\'s so much more that remains unsaid, so many things concealed or only barely hinted at.Part of that is because I don\\'t even want to confront the truth myself, let alone betray any hint of that truth to anyone else. I don\\'t really know why; maybe it\\'s embarrassment, maybe it\\'s pride, maybe it\\'s just another way to pretend that everything isn\\'t as totally fucked up as it really is. But as things slide one more time into the gnawing dark... I have nothing left to lose. No reason to continue with the charade, no excuse to cower behind some facade of invented strength.Maybe by writing this I can accept what I\\'m so afraid of facing. Maybe I\\'ll be proven wrong. In a few days, it won\\'t matter either way.The truth is, I\\'m not strong. I\\'m not brave. I\\'m not a survivor. Every time I go through this, I go a little bit further. Every time I hurtle back down into the lightless abyss I want it to sting a little bit more. I don\\'t want the pain to stop anymore. I don\\'t want the demon that whispers in my own voice to be silenced. I want to succumb, to give in, to fold under the weight of all the dark things that have crowded out any semblance of hope.There are no words to communicate the depth of aloneness. Anyone who could have coined those words is already too far gone to carry them back to the realm of expression and understanding. I will follow them, soon, beyond the shapeless border that permits no re-entry. And then I, too, will be forever cut off from the chance to return to the place where real people live, forever without a means to share with any clarity what I have seen. So I will use the only words I have available, and hope that somehow they might capture some essence of the truth. I can\\'t imagine what good it could do, but perhaps I will rest easier knowing that I\\'ve done all I could to explain myself. I know that no matter what I say, nobody will really understand why; nobody will be able to accept the simplicity of the decision. Maybe that\\'s a good thing; no one should have to quietly shrug away the bitterness of this. So even if no one truly understands, at least I won\\'t be able to blame myself for not telling them.I moved more than a dozen times growing up. I don\\'t understand the concept of \"home\" that people talk about; the word has no meaning to me. The building I live in is just a convenient location to sleep in; the area I occupy is just another faceless abstraction. It could be anywhere, it could be nowhere; it wouldn\\'t matter. My family is not close. The only person I know - the closest thing I have to the concept of a \"friend\" - is a guy I\\'ve known since first grade. He\\'s a lying, selfish, inattentive, abusive son of a bitch. Most of the time I think his presence in my life does more harm than good.But in an existence dominated by constant and wildly uncontrollable change, he\\'s a tiny sliver of stability. For a long time, I wanted something - anything - to be stable so desperately that I repeatedly looked the other way for all the years of mistreatment, neglect, and cruelty. The irony is that I can\\'t even go to him with these problems. I despise him, resent him, and more often than not wish I could bring myself to let go of that island of certainty; what\\'s the point of being sure of something when it\\'s always negative?It shouldn\\'t be much of a surprise that I\\'m very bad at interacting with people. Nobody knows that, because what I am good at is putting on a hell of a convincing show. Most people think I\\'m friendly, interesting, outgoing, funny... all they know of me is an act. I play the role of the likable guy that\\'s thoroughly OK, and I play it well. But I am not, and never have been, that person.I spent the day goofing off and joking with my coworkers about how it\\'s Friday and in a few hours we can go get a couple drinks and blow off steam for the weekend. I spent the day fantasizing about going home - not to break out the Scotch and watch some TV and unwind, but to lock myself in a dark room and suffer more. I used to enjoy my job; the last few days, I see it only as a way to burn a few hours until I can come back to my cave of pain and wallow in the catastrophic shit that has blocked out everything.For many years, I dreamed of romance. I wanted to meet someone who I could share life with, someone who could be a constant and help me establish the roots I\\'ve never had. As things worsened, I still had many of the same desires; but it was less about stability and certainty, and more about empathy. I just wanted someone who would always be there when I got home, someone who I could count on to smile gently and tell me everything\\'s OK, someone to cry alongside me in the middle of the night when I lay awake in an exhausted heap of agony. Someone to hide the knives and guns and household toxic chemicals. Someone to be strong and carry me when my own strength gave out.Now... I am conflicted. Just imagining putting someone through that makes me feel guilty. At times, I don\\'t feel like I deserve that kind of care; other times, I don\\'t believe that anyone would willingly offer it. I certainly could never ask anyone to commit themselves to a life of that kind of hell, dealing with me day in and day out. And I could never get close to anyone without telling her the truth of what I am; it\\'s bad enough that every outward facet of my life is a lie. I couldn\\'t live with myself if I duped some poor innocent soul into getting tangled up in my world.There\\'s still a lot of appeal in the idea. Every night, in the long moments between wakefulness and sleep, I can almost pretend that she\\'s there. Almost imagine the reassuring warmth of her curled up beside me. Almost smell the hints of her. Almost hear her whisper that she loves me, that nothing can stop us, that I have a reason to live.Almost.Some nights I fall asleep this way. Some nights I carry on my helpless fantasy in a warped maze of half-coherent dreams. Every night I wake up again and realize that all of it is in my head, that my deluded cravings are so far from reality that they may as well join the ranks of the hallucinations and voices and grandiose obsessions. Sometimes I will spend interminable hours broken down to tears. Most of the time I\\'m just numb to the ludicrousness of it all, the pathetic desperate plea for something I know I will never have.When I\\'m really, truly honest with myself, I know I\\'d never accept it even if it were offered to me.My purpose in this world is to hurt, and to hurt alone. No mountain of reasoning or persuasion will convince me that I am wrong. I may pretend to change my mind for a time, may even allow some fraction of my mind to embrace the notion, but in the sturdiest foundation of my soul I will never believe that I could be loved. Not like that.What probably hurts the worst is knowing how much of a despicable, idiot child I must sound like even to say this. So naive, so ignorant, so obsessed with something trivial and trite, so bound by the knots of ugly self-loathing and self-pity and denial.A close runner up, though, is being told that I\\'m wrong. Happy people find it so damnably easy to promise that things get better, that you can find what you truly want in life, that it\\'ll be OK. Stuck up in their insular, spotless ivory towers of not being fucked up and broken and ruined and worthless. Incapable of saying anything with meaning or believability. Good intentions mean nothing, no matter how genuine. They can reach out as hard as they like, but they will never be able to touch the reality of my situation. To do that, you have to be down here in the dark and the mud and the blood and the hurt.She\\'s just a myth, a fantasy, an idea that once gave me something to look for and some reason to keep tolerating the world for another day. Now she\\'s just an untruth that serves only to torment me more with the thought of what I cannot and will not have. The only purpose she serves is an obstacle. As long as she haunts me, I will never be free to leave this place in peace. Until I kill her, I cannot kill myself.I feel that I\\'ve stopped making sense, that I\\'ve rambled too long in self-indulgent tripe, that the sheer absurdity of what I have said cannot possibly merit any kind of response. I know how ridiculous and stupid and empty all of this is.But it\\'s what I feel, and it\\'s the truth. It\\'s all I have left. I\\'m not asking for sympathy, or understanding, or caring, or anything really. I\\'m doing this for myself, because I will never be able to move on if I cannot admit the facts that sit before me.I don\\'t know what comes next. I don\\'t know if I\\'ll feel better later, or worse, if I\\'ll finally make good on the years of threats or if I\\'ll miraculously dredge up yet another feeble excuse to keep on going.But I will fall asleep soon, drained and exhausted and bereft of any energy to deal with this any more for today. Tonight I will sleep alone.And probably every other night, too. Is this shitty ride over yet? Is this shitty ride over yet? It\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve wanted to drive a blade into my own flesh.The sensations return - long lost, yet still familiar and oddly comfortable, like an old jacket dug out of the back of a dusty closet. Everything is paradoxically darker than it should be. Nothing is enjoyable anymore. All I want to do is sleep until the discomfort goes away, but I find myself battling an increasingly resilient case of insomnia.I know this will never stop. My choices are either to live with the periodic suffering for the rest of my miserable existence, or to put an end to all of it and just rest forever... and judging by where I\\'m posting right now, it should be obvious that the latter is beginning to win the mental vote.My outward daily life is a carefully crafted sculpture of lies, designed to hide the reality of my world from everyone - sometimes even from myself. Tonight, the concealment is broken; perhaps not from anyone else, but I can\\'t stay in denial any longer. I hurt, deeply and fundamentally, and pretending that it will just go away is going to solve nothing.Alienation and loneliness are essential ingredients in my world. It couldn\\'t exist without them, and yet those very things are part of what drags my mind back into the downward spiral of yet another depressive episode. I can\\'t tell people the truth. I\\'ve done that before with disastrous results. But I need _someone_ to know - someone besides the doctors, visited stealthily to avoid tipping off anyone else; someone besides the internet strangers, begged incessantly for support without results.I stood on my porch this afternoon, burning through a countless number of cigarettes for lack of anything useful to do with myself, and wondered what the fuck I\\'m even trying for.It\\'s all just materialistic horseshit, and I don\\'t care about any of it. The job, the hobbies, the recreation, the wasteful endless hours of meaningless idiocy that everyone seems content to call \"life\" - there\\'s no goddamn point.

       " \" Getting sober and facing reality hurts so damn bad Getting sober and facing reality hurts so damn bad I've got twenty three days clean today and my life is s*** . I was working earlier at my grandparents they pay me some money to come over four times a week and cook and clean for them. &amp; I started 2 have an anxiety attack out of nowhere. This voice in my head telling me I'll never be good enough everything I do is pointless and that I'm a worthless piece of s*** . Maybe voice is the wrong way to describe it its just this recurring thought that no matter what I do it's never enough. I had just been cleaning my grandma's room and she's got prescription pills in there they both have pills that I've stolen in the past and gotten high off of. And when I was freaking out I won't lie I thought about going to go get some and using them. I know this is the reason that I started using drugs in the first place to escape my feelings of worthlessness. Everyone around me sees a happy smiling strong person and I'm on the inside screaming wondering why nobody can see my pain and knowing that I can never show them because it would overwhelm them. I've been going to group meetings and talking about the changes in my life now that I'm clean and it helps but these feeling still come. Facing my reality I'm constantly suicidal lately. I had to cut my dad out of my life yesterday because him and his girlfriend refuse to support me in my efforts to get clean and they think its okay to smoke weed in front of me when I come over to visit them. My dad has also never been around for me in my life growing up due to his own mental problems and difficulties dealing with life. I've built up the relationship that we have in the past few years but I always hold back how I really feel which is resentment and anger that he was never the dad he was supposed to be. So yesterday I finally got all of it out and told him how I felt and told him that his anger has stolen my voice more than once because I was scared to tell him my real opinion. My mom is no help she is shacked up with my ex boyfriend. Completely emotionally un supportive and never willing to stand up for herself or me she always has been. Also a control freak . I keep telling myself to just keep pushing forward and it will be better. I'm going to save up and get an apartment I'm going to get another job so I can do this more quickly and yet the voice in my head is holding me back. Its telling me that I can't handle another job that I'll never get out of this place that I'm doomed to just be a failure for ever and I might as well end it. I'm so scared that I'm going to fail I don't even want to try anymore. Being raised by my mom she made me feel like I had to be perfect all the time and I could never f****** measure up. Even though she's fat and ugly and has no room to make anyone else feel bad about themselves I always loved her and trusted her and I just believed everything that she said and I believed that I could never be good enough. Now I see how she really is and I just want to die my life is been one big f****** joke. Always with self doubt and failure ruling my life. I let her control me and dominate my life and it was all because I was too scared to just defy the one person who had never left me and stand on my own two feet. I was a scared and weak person and I still am. I just don't know anymore I just don't know anymore  \",\n",

I know a lot of you might scoff at this notion but it really is. _PERSON_ in post 9/11 Bible Belt is even harder. But really when I think about it it was always tough being me in this place and this time.     Born in the middle of nowhere hicksville USA, a brown baby that never quite fit in anywhere. My parents weren't abusive actively per se more unavailable, I learned at an early age that I was pretty much on my own. School was bad, if people weren't actively bullying me they were mostly pretending that I didn't exist. As a child I often hoped that this was the case, often wondered how nice it would have been not to been born. Odd, a child of kindergarten age regretting his own birth. The awkward middle school years weren't much better. More of the same, standing on the outside looking in. Seeing all the happy people, smiling faces, friends being friends, young love blooming in classrooms. I saw all this and wished it for myself and how I tried to get it. It never worked, I was met with near constant reminders that I don't belong, I don't fit in, no one wants me here. Stupid optimistic me thought it might change in the future. Fast forward to high school, still a loner, but not one of those creepy trench coated combat boot wearing ones. I try to be nice and friendly but it still is mostly thrown back into my face. This is about the time I started trying to find a girlfriend too. Foolish me didn't know down that road lay only more rejection and isolation and pain. After high school I did a 7 year stint in the Army, active duty infantry, saw a bit of action on deployments. What builds better bonds between people than shared danger and having to trust someone else to have your back and keep you alive? What builds better bonds? Well all of that with the exception that you can't be me. The only friend I did have in the Army I watched get blown apart by an IED. Came back from war to go to college, a late 20's freshman. Awkward, I felt like _PERSON_. A catholic private school was my choice due to the good science and pre-professional school program, but socially the place was...not inviting. I never could quite break down the barriers and get close to me. I stopped marking my birthdays long ago, facebook can be so cruel to remind you that it's your birthday when you have no one wishing you a happy one. Would have been a futile wish anyway. My best friend on birthdays came in bottles. I tried making friends or girlfriends at 21+ watering holes, events, school clubs. More and more this failed and the isolation really began to set in. They say no man is an island, this is true, unless he is forced to be.    As a side note, I have tried that whole online dating thing with more of the same result. That is to say nothing but rejection and being ignored. If for some odd reason you want to see my profile on a site, PM me.\",\n",

It started, when I was born.As far as my memories reach, I was never able to find friends.

They thought I was strange. Bullied me. I only got an opportunities to talk more with people I wanted to, when theirs friends were not present. It was years of sadness, of lonelyness.Parents and my relatives always said I was pessimistic, tried to cheer me up. But they didn\\'t understand what I really needed.Christmas then was, and still is, a celebration I hate the most. My parents were always saying that Santa can bring me anything I wanted. But they were lieing. Cause I needed a friend, a person who wouldn\\'t bully me, who enjoyed talking with me.Years have passed, I started attending a school. But besides that, nothing was changing. Yes, I met new people here. But they were the same shadows of the past, haunting me with their bad words. People were either ignoring me as a person, or bullying me. They only wanted good for themselves, ignoring my feelings and needs. I failed to find friends here too. I was a freak, listening to \"funeral music\", as they called it.Even when I actually thought I found a suitable person, possible friend, they berrayed me. Joined those who hated me. Then I started regretting trying to find friends and thought it would be better just to be alone. But it led to even darker times.

So within a month or so, I have lost the people closest to me in my life and Im possibly stuck with some mental/emotional problem, Im only 17 with very little life experience and have extreme problems making close friends, they were the first true ones and this has happened...

I want my pain to go away... Been posting alot in here and the pain keeps coming Been posting alot in here and the pain keeps coming I lost the love of my life. So I\\'ve been trying to move forward. Trying to pick up the pieces. Each day is a struggle for me. I met a girl online and we met up and we were alot alike. Had everything in common. I was still in pain but I thought hey this might be a chance to move on. We had a night filled with gaming, magic the gathering, good food and just all around good times. I didnt expect much out of things but I had hopes. She messaged me last night after I noticed she wasnt talking to me much. I got rejected again. Hoping we can be friends but she hasnt responded to that part. I dont know if I can take much more of being rejected like this from people. Id like to consider myself a good person. I live my life the best I can. Ive only ever asked for one thing and that is someone to love me for me. I thought I had found that with my ex but she betrayed my heart. I am breaking. I ask god why. I ask what have I done to deserve this? is there some underlying answer im not seeing? Im so tired... This pain... It is killing me...

My heart is turning to darkness. The pain caused, I can feel the demon wings come forth from my back, I can see my eyes become black as night. Bearing my fangs now. I am becoming hatred. \"you live long enough to become the villian.\" The innocent world you saw as a child, with the veil lifted as an adult, the truth of what is. Why do we exist only to see. Why do we exist to feel this pain. Will there ever be an answer? The darkness in my heart is growing The darkness in my heart is growing I feel like im at a tipping point. I feel like if I dont end my life I may lose myself and boil over. There is anger that does not sleep. A pain that cries for vengeance and revenge. I am losing myself. It seems silly to even make a reference like this but I feel like A jedi who lost his way and is becoming closer to the dark side... Waking up always in pain Waking up always in pain So many nightmares, all of them about the same person, I am lost without her, I am in so much pain... In all that we are...love is what matters In all that we are...love is what matters   Pain that doesn\\'t stop Pain that doesn\\'t stop I won\\'t go into details about the why, I\\'ve posted enough here recently that I\\'m tired of telling my story. All I know is pain in every moment of every day. Mental and physical. I fear it getting close to doing it. Ending things. I want relief. I want it to stop. I am so tired... Desperate for friendship Desperate for friendship I only have a select group of friends but they are not always available and during these moments when the loneliness hits and all my thoughts give way, I tend to end up in a dark place. I just want more people to talk to so I can cope with a lot of what I am dealing with. There is a constant pain in my heart, please I just want to feel like I matter, I feel so alone... She needs to see this She needs to see this I have posted here alot as some of you may have seen and it\\'s all due to a single moment that crushed me and broke my heart in a way that every day is a fighting struggle for my very soul. I was with her for almost 4 years, we were in a LDR that eventually took it\\'s toll, the break up was mutual even though I didn\\'t really want it. I gave her the choice in the end and that is the way things turned out. In those first few weeks of January I was struggling but I was okay, then on February she broke the news that she was already seeing someone, it hadn\\'t even really been a month and she had already jumped into things with someone else, this was the moment that I broke. All my fears, all my self hatred came boiling to the front from my past a past she knew well enough of. I became worthless, she had moved on so quickly and it broke me and made me feel like all of a sudden I was worthless. I loved her I told her, I never wanted any of this, I broke down bearing all my emotions that I had hid. I wanted to die. I had to see a therapist and take medication from that moment forward because of what wad done. Fast forward 2 months later, she tells me he is taking her to Hawaii for her birthday, thanks for telling me that, they get engaged there. She sends me a picture of the moment, a picture of her hand on top of his with the ring on her finger. We were supposed to get married and have kids. This not supposed to be how this ended. The picture is the same picture me and her took when we were dating of my hand holding hers in the final day of her visiting me, we were waiting at the airport for her flight home. That was supposed to be my hand holding hers with the ring on her finger. We were together for almost 4 years, they knew each 3 months. I still love her, every day. I wake up wishing I had never woken because of what she has done to me. I hope she sees this. I know she feels guilty she told me so but I don\\'t think she really cares at all, if she did none of this would of happened. She only really ever cared about herself, even in our relationship, she put herself first instead of us. I worked hard for us, working a full time job and going to school full time while she stayed at home with her dad doing nothing. I spent every poor penny I had for her. I sacrificed friends and even spending time with family for her. I was there for her in her pain dealing with her mother and her sister. I was always doing things for her. I hope she sees this. I hope she knows the type of person she is, someone who is lazy and willing to let someone else shoulder the weight of a relationship while she basks in the good life. She never earned a thing in her life, she doesn\\'t have the courage to, and when the moment comes where one day she has nothing she will truly know my pain... Just want to say thank you Just want to say thank you I just want to say thank you to all of you who have talked to me and helped me through what I have been dealing with recently. I have posted here a lot trying to get my thoughts out of my head and while things are still tough I am healing and I am getting better. It will take a long time before the pain and heartache I deal with ever really eases, and the memories will never ever go away. But there is hope on the horizon. I am doing my best each day not to let the memory of her hold me down and put me in a bad place. I want her to be happy in the long run but I fear her tests are still to come for the things she has done. Just as much as this is my test, a test of character and strength and perseverance. There is hope for all of us and we can pull through! I may still post here from time to time to get my thoughts out so they don\\'t fester but I just wanted to say thank you to this sub reddit and to the people who patted me on the back and gave me a shoulder to cry on. Again Thank you, you all saved my life :) Waking up Waking up I wake up every morning still wishing I hadn\\'t woken up and for one reason, the knowledge that as I awake she is no longer there but sleeps next to someone else. It breaks me knowing this, and tears apart my heart every day. I wish I had never met her so that I never had to experience this pain.. _PERSON_ _PERSON_ I drove by all the places we used to hang outI thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way it tastedAnd even though you tell me your doin\\' fineAre you somewhere feeling lonely even though he\\'s right beside youWhen he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?Sometimes I start to wonder; was it just a lie?If what we had was real, how could you be fine?\\'Cause I\\'m not fine at all...I remember the day you told me you were leaving,I remember the makeup runnin\\' down your face.And the dreams you left behind you didn\\'t need them,Like every single wish we ever made.I wish that I could wake up with amnesia,And forget about the stupid little things.Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you,And the memories I never can escape;\\'Cause I\\'m not fine at all...The pictures that you sent me, they\\'re still livin\\' in my phoneI admit I like to see them, I\\'ll admit I feel aloneI keep asking why you\\'re not around...It hurts to know your happy, yeah it hurts that you\\'ve moved onIt\\'s hard to hear your name when I haven\\'t seen you in so longIt\\'s like we never happened, what is just a lie?If what we had was real, how could you be fine?\\'Cause I\\'m not fine at all...I remember the day you told me you were leaving,I remember the makeup runnin\\' down your face.And the dreams you left behind, you didn\\'t need them,Like every-single wish we ever made.I wish that I could wake up with amnesia,And forget about the stupid little things.Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you,And the memories I never can escape.If today I woke up with you right beside me,Like all of this was just some twisted dream;I\\'d hold you closer than I ever did before,And you\\'d never slip away, you\\'d never hear me say:I remember the day you told me you were leaving,I remember the makeup runnin\\' down your face.And the dreams you left behind, you didn\\'t need them,Like every-single wish we ever made.I wish that I could wake up with amnesia,And forget about the stupid little things,Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you,And the memories I never can escape.\\'Cause I\\'m not fine at all...I\\'m really not fine at all...Tell me this is just a dream,I\\'m really not fine at all. Babycakez Babycakez That was what I called her, I\\'m getting stronger babycakez, I\\'m pushing myself, I found work again, I started excersizing again today. Every day I shall push myself to be better and then maybe you will love me again... I don\\'t know what to do.. I don\\'t know what to do.. I\\'ve been posting here for a bit and some of you may know my story and most of you don\\'t but I am in pain every day.. Is there something wrong with me? I go to bed and she is there in my mind, I have dreams and nightmares about her, I wake up and she is there, I go to work and she is there, I try to find things to keep my mind off of her and she is there too.. I\\'ve gone to therapy, taking medication but it\\'s not enough she is still there.. I pushed her away, I broke her heart in that moment last June, I didn\\'t work hard enough for her, then in January after we had spent some time trying to work on things it all ended. I don\\'t think she loved me anymore.. Almost 4 years we were together, she is my soul mate, my best friend and the love of my life and I let it all go, I let my depression get the better of me and I pushed her away... Now I regret it every day.. 1 month after we ended she found someone else, 2 months later they went to Hawaii and she got engaged.. I was supposed to be the one to marry her and we were supposed to have kids together start a family, now I am alone again, I have nobody, I would spend all my time with her because we were long distance, every waking moment, I pushed aside friends and family for her, I worked full time and went to school full time for her, I gave everything I had to give us a life, but in the end it wasn\\'t enough... He is well off she tells me, can give her what she wants, what we wanted.. All I wanted was for you to help me, build our relationship so we could work to that goal, now she found someone who gives her a chance to be a housewife and stay at home mom just like she always wanted... She got everything she wanted in an instant when she met him.. Didn\\'t really have to lift a finger to do it.. And I was the one who was left behind to pick up the pieces of my heart, to see the ring on her finger in a moment that should of been ours to share... Just like that last night on our first dates when she was flying home.. The true moments I fell in love with her, when I knew she would be my forever... Why do I still dream of her? Why do I cry for her almost every day? I try to push forward, take up new hobbies, excersizing again, try to focus on work but nothing helps, I still wake up with my heart breaking every day, knowing she is not lying next to me like it used to be.. I don\\'t want to wake up anymore.. I don\\'t want to dream about her anymore... Please make the pain stop.. A kitten to help me smile A kitten to help me smile With everything I\\'ve been through lately, and all the heartache I\\'ve endured I told myself I would do everything I could to move forward and to find a way to smile again. I\\'d like everybody to meet my new source of happiness! Her name is Joy :) _URL_ she put a smile on all your faces like she has me! Desperation Desperation I\\'m 30 years old, I have a full time job and I\\'m hoping to finish school in a couple of years, my ex didn\\'t think this was good enough and after being together for almost 4 years In a LDR she abandoned me and found a guy in less then 30 days who was rich and got engaged to him 2 months later. It broke me and I had to get therapy and brought up a past depression that I had to fight from killing me. So the question I have is a little more directed to the ladies but am I dateable? Here is a picture _URL_ of me. My confidence is pretty low because of what she did. I carried that relationship and tried to work towards what she wanted why she stayed at home comfy not working or going to school. But I wasn\\'t good enough in the end. I don\\'t have six pack abs but I have a good heart and all I want is a partner and someone to love me for me and want to share in the relationship.. Just looking to find some confidence, I\\'ve posted here alot but have been fighting and just looking to see what people say. I\\'m going backwards.. I\\'m going backwards.. I don\\'t understand, I was doing so well, I woke up this morning and I just really wished I was dead, had to leave work early because I was about to lose my shit. The one person I wish cared doesn\\'t care at all... I don\\'t know if I\\'m gonna make it through this, the ups and downs are so constant, she was the one person that gave me something to live for, I wanted to give her everything, what is wrong with me :( I can\\'t bear this anymore.. I can\\'t bear this anymore.. I don\\'t exist to her anymore, after everything I gave, with what little I had I spent all my time with her, I sacrificed friends and family for her because we were long distance, I worked hard and saved up to finish school for her, after almost 4 years together her repayment after we had our ups and downs was meet a guy in less then a month and get engaged 2 months later in Hawaii because he was well off.. I gave her my heart, I had my problems sure, we even broke up for a day because I was tired of the distance, but I didn\\'t really want it so we got back together and tried to work on things, she didn\\'t work she didn\\'t go to school, I tried to convince her to go to school because she was an excellent cook! But she was too scared didn\\'t want to end up in debt, wanted someone to take care of her. I wasn\\'t enough, now I don\\'t exist, I don\\'t think she ever truly loved me, and knowing that is breaking me, I am starting to really hate my human life, we are greedy and hateful people and I am one of them. I have no hope for this race and if it were up to me I hope we are all wiped off the face of existence because of what we are.. Can you change my mind? Because I\\'m on the precipice of death and I want the pain to end.. I think my body is giving up.. I think my body is giving up.. Been feeling really tired lately, complete mental exhaustion, chest pain all the time, been using food as a way to cope, just eating and eating. So much damage done to me over time, my body is feeling it now. I wonder if i will get my wish and maybe I wont wake up the next time I fall asleep.. The one person I want to care, she doesnt.. I see the way the world is now, who I am, weak minded and weak willed. I am so very very tired.. Its Happened Again.. Its Happened Again.. I have hit rock bottom and I have lost everything.. Lost the love of my life.. Lost my job.. Quit my job rather because my depression has been so overwhelming that the thought of work and being at work has makes me want to scream (I work in retail). I quit school... Probably have overburdened my family.. Im 30 years old and I cant do anything right... Its come to the point that I have to decide, do i sell everything and try to move and start over.. again. Because of course I have no money saved, I have about 200 dollars to my name right now. Or do i say fuck it and do what I have been wanting to do for all my life and that is just to jump off of a building and end my life. What do I do? I am lost.. Any advice would be greatly appreciated or heck if you are willing to let me crash on a couch so i can find work in a new place that would be cool too.. The funny thing is I dont fear death, more or less I fear what it would do to my family and friends. And mostly I fear missing out on many things that I could be experiencing, but this depression is so crippling.. I talk to a therapist, i take meds (although i have stopped because they werent working and making me sick), I have talked to therapy groups, and while they help for short periods, the depression is so overwhelming that the short periods of relief dont last long. I feel like I have dont everything i can to fight this and yet it is beating me.. Thank you for listening.',\n",

After months of depression and horrible dreams and thoughts I was sitting in class and got the overwhelming feeling that this was it, Im done. It was this freakish urge to just end it all. Today. Nothing in particular triggered it, it was a pretty average day, it was just- giving up once and for all. I was scared of it instantly and tried to push it away but I couldn\\'t. I posted in r/depression (where I\\'ve posted a few times before) about what I was feeling and two hours later I got a single reply telling me to call a suicide prevention hotline. I didn\\'t. I decided to just lie very still and not do anything. Eventually though I got restless and jumped on my bike. I started biking as fast as I could despite the pain in my legs and... Ugh .-. This is the worst part.. I hadn\\'t planned well, but the basic idea was I was going to bike to a large overpass and jump off. While I was biking though I heard an email alert from my phone that\\'s kept in my shirt and decided I may as well stop and check my one last email. It was dumb, just an advertisement but to check it I pulled over to a little gazebo where I got my phone out. While my phone was open I decided \"hey, may as well see if anyone else replied to that reddit post\" And they did, and they told me to come here. I layed crying on the gazebo bench odor a while then biked home.that was around three hours ago. I got tired of typing this. Anyway, now I\\'m scared I\\'ll do something stupid. I\\'m actually just really tired and lazy feeling now',\n",

       " \" Reddit, this took courage to write. Reddit, this took courage to write. I don't know where else to post this. I'm in the biggest shithole predicament of my life up to this point, and I feel as if I have no way out. I was recently arrested (about four months ago) for two felony drug possession charges. My house was raided because my roommate, unbeknownst to me, was selling drugs out of our house and ended up selling to an undercover. One day, I answered to a knock on the door to a gun in my face, and all of a sudden dozens of cops started running into my house. They had a warrant to search the entire premises. During that time, I had anti-anxiety medicine (not prescribed to me) in my possession, as well as weed, safely kept in my bedroom. The police searched my room, found the drugs, and arrested me.I was in school to become a teacher. I was student teaching during the time of the arrest. My students were everything to me, the particular group of eighth graders I was student teaching at the time confirmed my decision to be a teacher. I was making straight A's, finally feeling happy and fulfilled with my life, and knowing this is what I wanted to do. I would occasionally take a half of one of the anti-anxiety meds before teaching to lower my heartbeat and feelings of nervousness, hence the reason I had them. I tried going to therapy, but the doctors I saw never helped me and I just couldn't talk to them. I have a hard time talking to anyone. I would come home, do my homework, and smoke a few bowls once I was finished with all of my work to relax, and as a reward at the end of the day. I enjoyed it, and I didn't see anything wrong with it. I never partied, or brought the drugs out of my house. I am a very introverted person, and almost always kept to myself. Teaching was one of the ways I always felt would help me get over my extreme social anxiety issues. In the few months following the arrest, I was not able to return to student teaching, which means all of my former students were basically under the impression that I ditched them. I had to change my major, and move out of my house. I lost the few friends I did have due to my depressive, introverted personality. I currently live with my boyfriend, who is incredibly supportive. My parents are disappointed in me. All I ever wanted to do was make them proud, help people, and just be happy with my life. I feel as if I have lost almost everything that meant anything to me.I finally am facing the fact that I might actually do time in jail. I have a good lawyer, but after doing extensive research through my lawyer and the internet, I found out this particular District Attorney and judge(s) almost always sentence people with felony drug possession charges in my area to jail time. I would honestly rather die than have to spend any time in jail.All I wanted to do in this world was live a life helping people, and trying to be happy. The fact that I might have to go to jail, postpone my life for years to come, and become a convicted felon is driving me back into a downward spiral. I am not a bad person. I have never stolen anything in my life, and I have never hurt a fly. I don't understand what I did to deserve this. I have considered suicide in the past, but never as much as I have now. I feel as if society and the world in general doesn't want me here. I have already planned my suicide entirely, as well as when I will do this. I don't really know if anybody will even read this. I just need somebody, anybody, to hear me. Give me your opinions if you choose, I am willing to accept anything anyone wants to say. Thank you for listening, Reddit.tl;dr, Wanted to be a teacher, got arrested, realized I can't do that, became unhappy, now I just want to die\",\n",

       " ' I may be posting in the wrong place, but I just need to get a few things out. I may be posting in the wrong place, but I just need to get a few things out. Lets start nicely, shall we? I\\'m not going to kill myself. Four weeks ago, I finished my freshman year of college. I made friends, got great grades, and even got asked out. It wasn\\'t a bad year. However, a *few* things were wrong... My parents, especially my dad, have been putting on the pressure to constantly be better at everything. They keep reminding me that I don\\'t go to school to make friends... \"in a couple of years, you won\\'t remember anyone you met at college\" ect. This is disheartening because I\\'ve never really had close friends before. Suddenly, I have people I care about, and I\\'m being told to not care. Also, I know I have detachment issues. I push people away, simply because I\\'m pretty private. I keep my emotions in check, and some people don\\'t like that. This semester, I had a guy express interest in having a relationship with me, but he was put off by the fact that I didn\\'t really *give* him the emotional response he was looking for. To add to the \"guy problems\", I don\\'t know if I\\'m even interested in guys at all. I\\'ve always found girls more attractive, but I\\'ve never had any sexual experiences to sway me one way or the other. I\\'m 19, and I\\'ve never even kissed anyone else. Maybe asexual? My lack of experience isn\\'t really bothersome, but rather the confusion associated with it. Anyway, I had minor problems while in school, but now that I\\'m home, things have gotten infinitely worse.  My parents just want me to get a job, and at this stage in my life, that\\'s all I want too. I\\'ve applied so many different places, but I can\\'t seem to even get a return call back from them. My resume is stacked, and I\\'m a very personable person. I\\'ve handed most of my apps in in-person, and I\\'ve followed up. After 4 weeks of looking for a stupid, min-wage summer job and having no result, I\\'m beginning to feel terrible about myself. Having a job was the only thing I had planned this summer, and so no I have no purpose. Also, I\\'m totally alone. I live in a really rural area where most of my friends live no closer than 15 minutes away by car. My best friend is currently 3 hours away, and will be the entire summer. Because I\\'m a detached person, I\\'ve dug myself into a hole, and have very few close friends at the moment. I\\'m alone 80% of the day, and when I\\'m around people, I tend to be irritable and angry, which is not normal for me. I don\\'t know if there\\'s anything to be done here. I just needed to tell somebody stuff. I write a lot of this stuff down, but I never tell anyone because that\\'s just not who I am. Lastly, not to drop the bombshell, but I used to self harm. I thought I had stopped, but over the past semester, I cut 4 times. I\\'m ashamed about it, which is the main thing that keeps me from doing it now that I\\'m home, but it really helps me relieve emotional pressure. Emotional pressure is building, and I don\\'t know how long I can sit in my house all day feeling hopeless and helpless without something snapping. sorry for rambling. Have a lovely day. I\\'m glad you\\'re all here. Thank you.',\n",

I wake up overwhelmed by consciousness. I don\\'t dream. Not often. Make once or twice a year. I usually die in those dreams. The morning after a dream is a morning I wake up more disappointed than usual. I try to sleep in on those mornings. Sometimes, if you go right back to sleep, you can continue dreaming.',\n",

I haven't been diagnosed, mostly because my parents refuse to take me, but it's hard to talk to people and I cry every night about how lonely I feel, so I guess I'm depressed.Anyway, the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because of a girl in my theater class. She's always noticed when I feel like shit, and she always came to talk to me about it. It felt like she cared more about me than anyone else in my life, and it also helped that she was really pretty.I'm in love with her. She has a boyfriend, and he's great, and they have a great relationship, but I still love her. I would be dead without her, so I feel like I owe her my life. With many girls in my school, I say I want to date them, but she's different. I know that I would die for her if I had to.Now that I've graduated, and she lives in a different city, I know I'll never see her again. I've been told to move on, but I can't. With her, I know what it's like when someone cares about you, and I can't imagine any girl that could replace her. I've cried every night because of her. Whenever I try to focus at school or talk to someone, I think of her and I have to leave the room to cry.At this point, I know I'll never move on from her. My death is the only progress I'll ever make in life. I can't find a reason to live. I've posted this to /r/depression and /r/depressed and no one responded, so I guess no one cares.

       " ' Running on Empty and Still Running Running on Empty and Still Running I guess I\\'m writing here because writing feels good, and if I were to write on something like Tumblr, I might worry people who know me. I don\\'t want that.I haven\\'t told anyone, but there\\'s two letters on the side of my bookshelf facing away from the door. I live with three wonderful roommates; they would never spot it unless they would go into my room - which they never do. One says \"So I Just Died (Bummer) Now What?\" which are instructions on what to do with my stuff. Not will kind of decision making, more stuff that\\'s in their power. Who they might want to call and why, how to handle my funeral should my parents bury me as a boy (let them grieve and do your own potluck or thing should you want), etc. The second letter has more information.I\\'ve had suicide ideation for a very long time. It ebbs and flows. First started when I was 5, not really understanding it, maybe not really meaning it. I told my parents, who then suspended me over the deep end of a stair case asking me if I wanted to die. They were well-meaning but bad parents. I did one half-hearted attempt as a teen with tylenols - the kind of thing I knew deep down wouldn\\'t work but somehow wish it would get me away from this. It\\'s been with me since. Sometimes it\\'s less. Right now it\\'s more.And I\\'m struggling. I know how I\\'ll do it (involves butane) and roughly where (not at home - don\\'t want to traumatize roommates or friends.) The truth is I really don\\'t see me being alive in 3 years. And it\\'s not for any immediate crisis. I haven\\'t lost a lover or a friend, the greatest difficulties around transitioning are behind me. I just feel empty. And I\\'m continuing on, I\\'m not sure why but I am, maybe because I feel I owe it to younger me, but I don\\'t know how much longer I can take this.I guess I should probably get on anti-depressants, but I\\'m really uneasy approaching the person who may or may not be my doctor (she\\'s not accepting patients but helping me transition after transphobia meant I couldn\\'t continue with my last doctor.) She\\'s made comments that she\\'d stop prescribing me hormone replacement therapy if warning signs came up; I\\'m afraid this could be construed as some.I don\\'t know. I just don\\'t want to be here. Ideal scenario is checking myself in a hospital, but they\\'d never take me because I\\'m too well, and I don\\'t want to take the place of people who need it.

Yet I feel nothing, no sense of rejuvenation, might as well relapse and die. I no longer fear the slipping descent into the unconsciousness of death. I've never had anything to fear when I overdose on heroin, in the blink of an eye, I had gone from conscious of an eternal bliss to a state of absolute disappointment for surviving the OD. You might as well say I'm lucky I shot up around friends,  lucky enough for them to have called 911 on me. I faced my mother's despair and sadness in the hospital that day, and I could just feel her pain and I couldn't imagine how much worse it would've been if I had died that night. The thought of my own mother having to bury the tomb of her son who was barely a man makes me cry my eyes out and hate what I had done. My sense of compassion only goes to others, I feel nothing but pity towards myself. I hate myself for absolutely no reason. I have everything a child could wish for, a caring mother,  loving family, close friends, and a great body image. However, I can't escape my sense of despair and life and absolute nihilism. Killing myself is the same as going to school, the feelings towards each is the same as in the way I approach both in terms or value, with purely rational thought. My own irrationality, the instinct for survival leads me to continue on living performing acts which only grant me even greater despair.  I have no choice for I am a selfless coward, I fear hurting my family and causing them pain, even post mortem. I wish I died that day I overdosed. It would've been a perfect time to die. If my mother and family were gone, I would immediately kill myself through overdose, who wouldn't?  Yet I'm still suicidal in my daily life. I hate myself. I hate living. I hate crying. I hate happiness. They are no more greater than the other. Why can't I bring myself to commit suicide, I lack the conviction for one of life's greatest choices, this just adds more to my depression.\",\n",

I live in a peaceful town of Aurora OH with my dad and step mom. When I was young, my parents got divorced. This damaged me internally. I now almost never get to see my mom. I have been living with my dad for the past 11 years. My dad is diagnosed with a mental problem called bipolar. This has been affecting me TREMENDOUSLY as he goes from one mood to another within a matter of minutes. My step mom is nice sometimes but she doesn\\'t like a lot. My dad is tired of my of what I do. I love computers. I worship them. I have made my own computer and have made it for gaming. I spend my own money on upgrading my rig and also buying and playing games. I love learning about technology and all about it. But unfortunately... that\\'s the only thing I like doing. I don;t do anything else. I have attempted to try other stuff. It just ever works out. I am socially awkward as it is very hard to make friends. I hate talking to other people and I am very shy. My dad doesn\\'t like me spending time with technology. He wants me to become like every other student. Play sports, have friends, and do well in school. I am not either of those. I hate physical education and not good. I don\\'t have a lot of friends neither do I like talking to people. I get C\\'s,D\\'s, and F\\'s in school. This year was my first year of high school. My first year in a public school. I am a christian and totally dedicated to the thought of heaven. This first year of highschool was the worst year of my life. I have kids all around me that smoke, do drugs, curse, and more. I don\\'t get bullied which is good. Maybe it\\'s because of my long hair :P The thing that gets to me is work. I HATE working. I have 0 motivation what. so. ever. to do anything. When it ranges from physical work or school work. I try to think that I can do it and do well in school but I can\\'t. My teachers are mean and they don\\'t teach well. There is just so much work that I can\\'t handle it anymore. I get stressed and frustrated very easily. I try to mention some of my feelings about school to my parents but they are not doing anything about it. They think it is some kind of joke. They don\\'t take it seriously. I want to find a way to motivate my self to do well in school but I can\\'t. There is nothing to motivate me. My parents yell at me and yell and yell and that is all they do. They think that is the way to motivate me. So does my teachers. I like to be alone with my electronics as this calms me down. I listen to music to calm me down as well. I also live with a brother that has anxiety, anger issues, and bipolar. He makes friends better then me. In fact, he is all of those things that I am not. He always does better in school. Straight A\\'s. I don\\'t know how he does it. I feel like school is a waste of time. I feel like teachers and parents don\\'t know what its like if they were us. Teachers are supposed to help students do better and find a way to motivate the students. Like I said, I and no one else has found a way to motivate me. I feel like school is not teaching you to become smart but everything is based on memory. I am totally against the idea of school. Everything about it. But it just gets to me. I am depressed in school. I don\\'t talk, don\\'t listen, get yelled at. I hate it and no one is doing anything to change it. I have been getting suicide thoughts since fall. They are becoming more frequent. They were monthly, then weekly, and now they are almost daily. I am depressed more frequently. I sometimes like to listen to Chill music and look at beautiful landscapes and say to myself, \"Will I ever achieve anything? Will I ever make it? Will I..... be alive in a year?\".  You guys are probably asking, you are killing yourself because of school and family in the summer? Yes it is summer and it is much more relieving. I have countless hours in my room spending time on my computer. This is probably all I do. I love it and enjoy it with a passion. My parents HATE IT SO MUCH. We were at the dinner table talking about regular things until school came up. I mentioned to them that this is summer and not school. It\\'s a break from school. They dont care what I say when its making choices for myself. My parents have forced me to play piano, soccer, karate, drama etc... I have quit all of them. I have never had a normal conversation with my dad or my step mom. Like literally. Never. Not even joking. They all end up with yelling at me. Just tonight did they yell at me again. I tend to back talk a lot which is not good. But I have no way of defending my self. They think all I do is play games. Not true. But they don\\'t believe me! They hate what I do with my life and that I should try other things! Like I said. I hate everything else. Just tonight they decided to wake me up every morning at 7 to study. I thought the work was done you know? I was so happy. I was not depressed as much. But this is gonna kill me. Literally. My parents hate me and I never get to see my mom a lot. But when I do, I love to stay with her. I want to live with her. But now that this is happening. I can\\'t take it anymore. This isn\\'t the first time my parents are fed up with me about school. This year I couldn\\'t go to a family reunion with my mom to Florida because of my grades. I really wanted to go and tried SOOOO hard in school. But my grades didn\\'t go up. They went down. I sit down and think about what i\\'ll be when I grow up. I don\\'t see anything good or anything at all. I don\\'t know what to do with my future. I don\\'t think i\\'ll be living by the time I am 20. I hate this society SOOO DAMN much. No one cares about anyone! NO ONE! Were ALL EQUAL you know?! ug! I am so unsuccessful I can\\'t take it anymore and I can\\'t take any more actions. I give up with my life. SO much work and no love and compassion to me. I cry every freaking single day by myself. I want to kill my self. I want to kill myself in the future. I don\\'t know when or how. I have no plans or way but I want to. I just need to stop this before I take action.

It likely wouldn\\'t but considering my grandfather doesn\\'t notice if I leave the house or not, I wouldn\\'t get medical help until thursday because that\\'s when my mom visits.I think the main reasons I haven\\'t done anything is because of my mom, my boyfriend, and my oldest niece who considers me her best friend.

I mean, mom\\'s busy worrying abiut grandpa\\'s health and I don\\'t want to burden her. I could get into a fight with my boyfriend and breakup with him...That could make it easier on him but that still leaves two people...I don\\'t know how to get help or what to do anymore...I\\'m still thinking about it but I still have a few things left to do. I\\'m buying my boyfriend\\'s birthday present next weekend and the weekend after I\\'m babysitting that niece I mentioned earlier. After that...I don\\'t know what there is to cling onto. I\\'ve been using family events for the past month just to get through each week. My body is a lie and I can\\'t keep living it. I\\'m sorry. My body is a lie and I can\\'t keep living it. I\\'m sorry. Sorry I just need to get this off my chest. Sorry for posting. Just need to unload on a place where nobody knows me.I know I sound crazy but hear me out. I\\'m a trans guy who will be 22 this may. I\\'m depressed, have a shit ton of anxiety and just recently got diagnosed with body dysphoria. I was born as a baby girl and yet I can\\'t identify with it. I recently got put on testosterone and hormone blockers to stop my body from producing estrogen.However it hasn\\'t made any big changes which I understand. That stuff takes time. But until then I\\'m stuck looking like this lie that I tell everyone around me. To random people who pass me by, they see a girl. To my gay best friend, I\\'m a girl (I\\'m not mad that he doesn\\'t like me...just wish my biology didn\\'t work against me). To my grandfather who I live with (thanks to everyone in my family urging me not to tell him) I\\'m a girl. To my mother who still doesn\\'t want to see her beautiful, thin, blond daughter who was everything she never was (her words, not mine) I\\'m still a girl. And I hate it. Typing this makes me feel sick to my stomach and angry.I...can\\'t do this anymore. I look at myself and see a person who I can\\'t continue to care about or identify with. I hate it more than I\\'ve hated anything else. I was always told that the worst thing I could do is lie. But living like this is just another lie that I can\\'t wait to unbubble. I can\\'t keep dealing with people seeing this false image of myself. Can\\'t stand to see this image of myself. Can\\'t stand to look myself in the eyes. I\\'m writing my goodbyes tonight. I just...I can\\'t say goodbye in person.I\\'ve had a lot of time to think about this. I got sick with the flu this week and was bedridden and by myself a lot. I used to date someone who feels like my opposite. Back then, she was just coming to terms with being trans and I supported her. I\\'ll admit it, I was jealous. I was jealous when I saw her smile when I did her makeup and hair. When she looked better in my clothes than I did I felt envy. That comfort she was able to see. She was able to see herself as a woman.I want that. Hard as I try to find anything that makes me look boyish, feminine attributes keep showing up. I can\\'t hide my chest (even with binding) and my mother is utterly against me getting a haircut that is \"too short\". Why the hell can\\'t I just do it regardless? I don\\'t know why it\\'s easier for me to come to terms with dying than getting her disapproval.Not to mention that in a couple of months I lose my medical plan so all of my meds are no longer going to be covered. There\\'s no way I\\'ll be able to afford everything. The antidepressants,  the anti anxiety meds, the asthma meds, and then the hormone stuff...especially with no job, I won\\'t be able to afford it. And if I went on disability, I\\'d just disappoint my mother again. She\\'s very vocal about how she wants me to get a steady job and go to post secondary. She\\'s terrified I\\'ll get disability. According to her, I\\'m not that bad off. The depression and anxiety isn\\'t that bad. I should be able to keep a job...it shouldn\\'t be an issue...Well at least this way, she can still have me buried with my legal female name. Might even be buried in a dress since I don\\'t have a suit. Guess she\\'ll still have that girl image she clings to. At least she\\'ll be happy with the way she remembers me._PERSON_: trans guy who can\\'t be patient with the time it takes to transition. Can\\'t stand the way his body looks and screams female and would rather die than continue lying by living.',\n",

       " ' The entire world is going to hell. Why do people persist? Why aren\\'t we allowed to give up? The entire world is going to hell. Why do people persist? Why aren\\'t we allowed to give up? Everything I read makes me convinced that we are headed towards a hellish existence: increased surveillance, resource depletion, climate change, economic instability, all subjects that are scientifically documented and with no practical solutions available to them. We will probably all live in a 1984-esque nightmare or end up farming for 12 hours a day and spending the rest of the time fighting for our survival.Dealing with this knowledge is more than I can bare. Just mentioning any sort of negative thing to my parents (and I hold back a LOT) has them immediately go into \"stop being so negative\" mode. I wonder if they are simply ignorant or aware of all this and just want to pretend it\\'s not happening.I wonder if I subconsciously want them to stop hoping. My greatest dream is that all my loved ones would come to me and say \"We have decided to give you a present: This pill will give you a painless death. Don\\'t worry about us, we know this is what you want. We will not mourn because we know that your suffering will end. Farewell and good luck\". Instead I keep at this because I don\\'t want to cause them pain. so I take it in return. I don\\'t want to live in hell. I spend at least 4 hours a day on the Internet. The presence of other people for long periods of time bores me. I don\\'t want to learn how to defend myself. I don\\'t want to lose all of this. I know I am a terrible person for it. I just wish that we as people weren\\'t forced to keep playing the game of life after we already lost. Why do I have to stay? Why do I have to stay? I never asked for this life. I never asked to feel disconnected from people. I never asked to be forced to get a job in a country where I don\\'t speak the language, have no time to learn it and is constantly on the brink of disappearing. Never asked to be in a world on the brink of collapse. Never asked to be raised my entire life to shun physical activity and be faced with a world in which we all have to toil in the dirt.I have lost the game of life. And yet I am forced to keep playing it. Only my family keeps me here. Even though I can\\'t relate to them either and they drive me crazy with their insensitivity to my pain. The only thing keeping me alive is my unwillingness to cause so much pain to those around me. I don\\'t want to leave the world a worse place than it is.Yet I keep dreaming about it. I drea that one day all those who care about me would give me a gun with a single bullet and say \"We understand that this is what\\'s best for you. We support your decision and we won\\'t mourn your passing. Good luck\". Just writing this makes me weep tears of joy. Possibly the greatest feeling of joy I can experience.I know this isn\\'t normal. But what can I do?',\n",

This isn't someone I know particularly well other than through IM; I'm reasonably sure they go to University of Iowa in the industrial design program. I've pushed them to talk to family, talk to their therapist, come here and talk to people on /r/SuicideWatch, and given them links to numbers to call in Iowa. They've rebuffed every option for one reason or another, saying that nothing will work.I honestly don't know what to do here; my own life is stupidly hectic right now and I can't devote a lot of time to pestering this person over IM to see if they're okay.

I had a meth head dad and my mom was never around so I basically raised my siblings with a little help from my grandparents. I swore I'd never touch drugs ever until my freshman year in high school. I started smoking weed and drinking and until I got a job that was it. Then I started doing other things and eventually it led to meth. I have been going slightly crazy because of the cravings for it (and I only did it once so dont ever fucking touch it) And recently I discovered I have a large hard lump on my vas defrins (part of your balls) and I'm almost positive it's cancer (haven't been to a doctor yet though). I'm not sure if I want to go to a doctor or not. I kinda wanna just wait to see if it grows and then go in if it does. If its fixable at that point then I'll let em fix it, if not I'm probably going to OD on meth instead of waiting for it to kill me.update- just got robbed tonight on my way home from work.\",\n",

Another thing is that I am in love with a girl and hse is in love with me and I can't be with her because she went out with a really close friend and it makes me feel shit that there is someone thta loves me but I can't be with them and it depresses me. I also had a friend who committed suicide 3 years ago and I have been thinking about it more than ever recently and I keep feeling like I might go down the same road. I say to everyone that I am feeling fine but that is just so they stop worrying about me. I am also very self concious and I always think of what other people think of me and most of it is negative so I just think really bad about myself. I'm not over weight, I am a good weight for my age and height according to a piece of paper but I feel so different to that.
