For example, unlike most people I can never concentrate on a lecture while taking notes or checking a text message on phone. I seem to lose track of what the instructor was saying very fast. Also, I can't listen to music and solve math questions at the same time. I can't even read an article on the web while listening to music. Similarly, when I'm watching sports on tv and I switch my attention to phone for checking twitter updates, I instantly lose focus of both. I can neither make much sense of tweets nor the match because I'm trying to focus on both. While most people on my twitter timeline or on IRC channels seem to be able to manage this very very well. Likewise, when I'm trying to concentrate on something it's like my other senses have stopped working. If i'm doing something (or even just thinking a random thought) and someone talks to me, I almost always have to ask them to repeat what they just said. How common is this problem?edit: another thing that just came to mind. Inability to focus on both audio and video in movies. Things seem to happen way too fast for me. Hence I always need subtitles while watching movies/tv shows. And if a movie doesn't have subtitles like in cinemas, i come out all confused not having understood most of the storyline for whatever reason.  This might also be because most movies/shows I watch are in english and english is not my native language but I seem to understand it very well. I've probably watched more american tv shows than even most americans. I have read a lot of english books and all. I can read, speak and understand english just fine.\"],\n",

Back in HS, just two/three classes would wear me out physically as well as emotionally and I would spend the rest of the day with moderate to severe headache not concentrating in classes at all. Now that I'm in college, I don't have to take consecutive classes but still whenever I take two classes in a row, I come back to my room and take a long nap. This despite getting at least 7/8 hours of sleep every night. My roommate gets through the day easily and only sleeps at night.Even when I'm not taking classes i.e I have a few days off, I can't study for extended periods of time. It gets harder and harder to focus as time passes. This has been getting in the way of me taking part in various activities and I doubt I'll be able to work long hours when I graduate.

One scenario where this could be useful is sports apps like sofascore. I currently have toasts enabled for it so that it sends me goal alerts and so on. However, since Action Center doesn't display full notifications, I have to open the app every time to find out who scored the goal and so on. A weird limitation.  Also, why is it not possible to clear individual notifications from Action center? What if I just want to clear one and keep the rest for an app as a sort of reminder for later? A better implementation imo would've been 'swipe the app title to the right to remove all notifications, swipe a notification to the right to remove just that one'. When I first used the Action Center, I was expecting it to be like this. It was disappointing to find out that is not the case.\"],\n",
